<h2><img style="float:right; margin-left:5px; width:15%;" src="clipart/scouting_logo.png">Organization</h2>

<p>Scouting is a multi-layered organization with the <a href="http://scouting.org">National BSA Organization</a> at the top and the individual scout units at the base. Councils are chartered by the National organization and each council is divided into districts. A district usually services a small geographical area.</p>
<p><img style="float:right; margin-left:5px; width:15%;" src="clipart/c10logo.png">Northern Trail district is part of the <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/">Circle Ten Council</a> and covers the same area as the Richardson Independent School District. The district team is made up of volunteers and usually one professional scouter.</p>
<p>The primary role of the district is to provide direct support to units with advice, training and district wide events for scouts, leaders and families. More details about our district may be found <a href="about-northern-trail.html">here.</a></p>

<h2>Newsletter / Calendar</h2>

<p>If you are looking for an activity, check the current <strong><a href="current-newsletter.html">newsletter</a></strong> and/or the district <a href="calendar-events.html"><strong>calendar</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The newsletter is the best way to keep abreast of the upcoming activities and opportunities for scouting in the district. We send out a newsletter once a week with occasional special emails when necessary. Sign up <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/email_signup_form.html">here.</a></p>

You can send the webmaster an email <strong><a href="mailto:webmaster@ntrail.org">webmaster@ntrail.org</a></strong> and get an answer or be directed to someone who can help you.</p>

<h3><img style="width:20%; float:right; margin-left:5px;" src="clipart/unit_commissioner.png">Unit Commissioners</h3>

<p>We have a team of scouting veterans called <a href="commissioner-service.html">commissioners.</a> They are led by the district commissioner. Every scout unit has an assigned commissioner, If you don't know who your commissioner is, contact the district commissioner. Contact information may be found <a href="district-leadership-0.html">here.</a> A commissioner is ready to provide answers to questions and advice about how to make your unit thrive. Don't hesitate to send an email to him or her. If you don't hear back, email the district commissioner.</p> 

<h3>District Leadership</h3>

<p>In addition to commissioner service, the district organization has several other functions, including membership, finance, risk management and program to name just a few. Check the <a href="district-leadership-0.html">District Leadership</a><a href="district-leadership-0.html"> </a>page for names and contact information for the district leadership team.</p>

<h3>Roundtables</h3>
<p>All Roundtables, Cub, Scout Roundtables and Venturing Forums are normally held on the second <strong>Thursday </strong>of some months. Watch the newsletter and calendar for updates and locations. These events are for all leaders and parents in all programs.  Training, tips and information about all aspects of scouting is available.  Check the <a href="current-newsletter.html"><strong>current newsletter</strong></a> or <strong><a href="calendar-events.html" shape="rect" target="_blank">calendar</a></strong> for details.</p>

<h3><img style="width:30%; float:right; margin-left:5px;" src="clipart/trained_patch.jpg">Training</h3>

<p>The real secret to understanding the scout program is to get training. Scouting has many training opportunities, online and in-person.</p> <p>Every adult who is involved with the program must have a current Youth Protection Card. There are no exceptions to this rule, and this is in place to protect not only the youth in the program, but the adult volunteers as well. To get this training go to <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>, create an account and take the training. Takes about an hour and is valid for two years.</p>

<p>In addition to Youth Protection training, there are many other training opportunities to help you not only understand how scouting works, but importantly ensure that all participants have an enjoyable, positive and safe experience.</p>

<p>Position training for your specific scouting role is essential to the success of the program. If you are a den leader, merit badge counselor, scoutmaster, crew advisor or a cubmaster, there is a training curriculum for you.</p>

<p>If you have questions about training, contact the training chair on the <a href="district-leadership-0.html">district leadership</a> team or your unit <a href="commissioners.html">commissioner.</a></p> 

<p>Watch the <strong><a href="current-newsletter.html">newsletter</a></strong> and <a href="calendar-events.html"><strong>calendar</strong></a> for upcoming training opportunities.</p> 

<h3><img style="width:15%; float:right; margin-left:5px;" src="clipart/eagle_patch.jpg">Advancement</h3>
<p>An important component of the methods of scouting is advancement. At the district level, a committee is in place to assist with helping your scouts advance. The Eagle rank in particular requires additional support at the district level. A team of <a href="eagle-designees.html">Eagle Designees</a> is available to assist with this process. They work with candidates on project approval and participate in Eagle boards of review. The advancement team also assists in identifying merit badge counselors.</p>
<p>If you have questions about advancement, contact the advancement chair on the <a href="district-leadership-0.html">district leadership</a> team or your unit <a href="commissioners.html">commissioner.</a></p>
<p> 

<h3>District Events</h3>
<p>In addition to training the district puts on a several events during the scouting year. In the fall we have recruiting events such as School Night for Scouting. We also have an event for Cub Scouts and their families called Northern Trail to Adventure. Webelos Woods is camping event tailored for Webelos scouts to give them a taste of ScoutsBSA. In January we hold a banquet to recognize leaders who have gone the extra mile to make the program successful. In the spring we have a Camporee which is a camping event for ScoutsBSA which provides scouts an opportunity to demonstrate scouting skills. In the summer the district sponsors Twilight Camp for Cub Scouts and Tigers. This is a week-long day camp at a local park.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the events in the district. Watch the <strong><a href="current-newsletter.html">newsletter</a></strong> and <a href="calendar-events.html"><strong>calendar</strong></a> for information about these and other events.</p> 

<h3>Adult Recognition</h3>
<p>Scouting only exists due the tireless work of volunteers and the unit, district, council and national level. We are indebted to these individuals who are critical to the success of the scouting movement.</p>
<p>Please take the time to nominate hard working scouters for recognition. A formal recognition is a tangible way to demonstrate to these individuals that their efforts are truly appreciated. Being appreciated is an energizing process and we need energized volunteers to energize scouting. <a href="adult-recognition-0.html">More information</a></p>
