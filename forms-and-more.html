<h3>Training:</h3>

<p>Training is an essential part of the program.  Every registered adult must have a current Youth Protection Training Card. In addition to youth protection, adult leaders must be position trained. Specific training is required for many activities.  Be sure that your leaders are properly trained for your planned activities.  On-line Training is available at <a href="http://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. You may view your training plan and history on the site.</p>

<p>In person training is also available. This training covers all aspects of the program from basic leader training to advanced outdoor activities. In person training is preferable because it is more interactive, and you will have the opportunity to meet other leaders, both new and experienced.</p>
<p>Watch the newsletter and calendar for information about available training. The District Training Chair can answer specific questions about training.  </p>

<h3>Planning Information:</h3>
<p>We all want to focus on the activities, but our first responsibility as leaders and parents is to ensure the safety of the scouts and adults in the program.</p>
<p>Training is the cornerstone of a safe program and trained leaders will better understand the hazards and how to avoid them and importantly how to respond and deal with incidents.</p>
<p>Below are some resources which can help. The Guide to Safe Scouting is a comprehensive source of information about every situation you may encounter in scouting.</p>

<h3>Roundtable</h3>
<p>Roundtables are run by the district commissioner staff and are designed to help leaders and parents get the most of the scouting program.</p>
<p>Roundtables are a mixture of training, networking, mentoring and a bit of fun.</p>
<p>This is the place to get your questions answered, learn what is happening in the district, opportunities for activities and more.</p>
<p>You will find new leaders and seasoned scouters who have a wealth of practical knowledge they are willing to share.</p>
<p>The topics vary and in some cases there will be breakout groups for the various scouting programs.</p>
<p>Theses meetings are held on a regular basis, but check the district <a href="current-newsletter.html"><strong>newsletter</strong></a> and <a href="calendar-events.html"><strong>calendar</strong></a>   for updates and program details.</p></div>
