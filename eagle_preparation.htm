<h2>Congratulations, you have achieved the rank of Life Scout!  </h2>

<p><img style="float:right; margin:4px;" src="clipart/eagle_patch.jpg">Now what?  Well, of course, you need 6-months as an active Scout and 6-months of leadership to progress to the next rank (EAGLE!).  You also must check off all the requirements of the Eagle Scout Application More information <a href="https://www.scouting.org/programs/scouts-bsa/advancement-and-awards/">here.</a>). Always get your application and project workbook from links available on this page.  That way you know you have the most current versions (a key factor) before you start getting signature approvals.</p>
<p>So, what order do you need to follow to accomplish all the requirements?  There is no specific order, just get them all done.  Which means you can start your project before you have completed your Merit Badge requirements for Eagle, or not.  It really depends on you and how you manage your time.  At Life Rank, you should be able to evaluate where you are, how much time you have available to get to your goal and manage your time.  But you MUST manage your time! </p>
<p>Let’s talk about something that seems to be affecting a lot of Life Scouts at the moment (and the one that affects the Eagle Designees at the Northern Trail):  writing the proposal for your Eagle Scout Service Project.</p>
<p>You begin by canvassing your potential beneficiaries for potential service projects and deciding on what you want to pursue (you can always change if things don’t work out).  Discuss the potential project with Adult Leaders in your Troop or Crew – you may have an Eagle Advisor on the Committee who has been asked to help Scouts through the process.</p>
<p>Once you have that idea, schedule a meeting, and discuss the project with your potential beneficiary and confirm they like your idea and want you to do it for them.  At the conclusion of that meeting, you should be prepared to get their signature and provide them with pages from the workbook titled “Navigating the Eagle Scout Service Project, Information for Project Beneficiaries.” </p>
<p>First steps, accomplished!  Now, work to get the other signature approvals from your Scoutmaster and the Committee Representative (again, hopefully that is an Eagle Advisor working for the Committee at your Troop).  </p>
<p>Second steps, accomplished! Once you have 4 signatures for your proposal (yours, the beneficiary, the Scoutmaster, and the Committee Representative) you should now be cleared to speak with the Eagle Designee assigned to your Troop or Crew.  The contact information should be made available to you by either the Scoutmaster or the Committee Representative.</p>
<p>Contact the Eagle Designee by email (best way) or by phone (not text, please).  Make sure you have included another adult on your correspondence.  You should tell the Eagle Designee your name, Troop or Crew number, and your age (so many are very close to aging out so it is Important information).  Ask the Designee for an appointment to review your proposal.  That meeting can be in person or via teleconference (like Zoom).  You’ll need to get your proposal and any diagrams/before-photos regarding your project ahead of the meeting so the Designee can review.  </p>
<p>When you meet, be prepared with pen and paper (or some note-taking method) as you will receive a lot of information that you might not have anticipated.  At this point, the Designee will tell you how to proceed.  Our Designees have a lot of Troops and Crews to support so it benefits everyone if you are prepared before you make that first contact.  If you are, then it is a smooth process, and you will get to the next steps with a minimum of difficulty.  Organization is key, be prepared and organized! </p>
