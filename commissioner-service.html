 <h2>Commissioner Service</a></h2>

<p>If you have been involved in scouts for a while and particularly if your Scout has moved on, commissioner service is a great way to keep up with scouting, continue to provide a valuable service, and make a difference.</p>
<p>A unit commissioner is an individual who is knowledgeable about Scouting in general and has first hand knowledge of the challenges which face new leaders. The job of a unit commissioner is more one of a mentor and sounding board for new leaders who are just getting started and need advice and encouragement. A commissioner is a representative; leading units is a tough job and having someone to look to for information, help with problems, and support unit health is valuable.</p>
<p>Other commissioner service roles include assistant roundtable commissioners to support all of the program-specific roundtable commissioners (programs for Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting and Venturing (with Sea Scouting, Varsity Scouting and Explorers). Roundtables provide units a place to meet and openly share knowledge and insight in support of operating a successful unit.</p>
<p>Commissioner service requires a minimal investment of time, but is very rewarding. If you think you might be interested in commissioner service, please contact our <a href="district-leadership-0.html"><strong>District Commissioner</strong></a>.
