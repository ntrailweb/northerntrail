<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Time to Say: Thank You</strong></p>
<p>Why do people volunteer?  For most of us, we volunteer because we believe in the program. In the beginning of my scouting career, volunteering in my son's troop provided the opportunity to not only contribute to scouting, but spend time with my sons. I had the opportunity to meet other parents and compare notes about the challenges of parenting. While most volunteers don't work for recognition, they do appreciate being thanked for their time and efforts. Recognizing volunteers who put in that extra effort to make the program great is a tangible way to say thanks. Yes, you have to volunteer and take the time to fill out a nomination form.</p>
<p>We have several awards to recognize these individuals beginning at the unit level with the Your Extraordinary Service Award or the Y.E.S. Award.  At the district level we have two awards: the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Applications for these awards must be submitted no later than Friday, December 10th. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>At the Council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Applications for the Silver Beaver Award must be received no later than Friday, November 12th.  No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>More information, including the submission details of these awards, is available <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <a href="mailto:mzi@gatech.edu">mzi@gatech.edu</a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>The re-charter process is now underway, and you can begin the process. Every unit must complete the re-charter process at this time each year. </p>
<p>There are 3 scheduled recharter clinics set, all at FUMC-Richardson all starting at 7:00 pm. The dates are <span style="font-weight:bold;">November 11, November 30, and December 9</span>.</p>
<p>Here are some documents which may help:<br />

<p>If you need additional help, please contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>Every year many units must scramble at the last minute to complete this important task. This makes it hard on everyone involved in process, please get started today. If you are not directly involved in the re-charter, you still need to get your dues paid and complete youth protection training if you have an expiring YPT card.</p>
