<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Eating an Elephant</strong> </p>
<p>There is an old saying in the time management world that if you must eat a elephant, you've best bet is to do in small bites. Some jobs are best broken down in to smaller tasks. An example is the annual re-charter process. Not all the difficult, but trying to do it all at once and particularly at the last minute, makes the job much more difficult. So like eating that elephant, start early, get organized and determine what you need. If you are not in charge of unit re-charter, remember that someone in your unit has that job and he or she will need your help. When they ask for paperwork or that very important task of completing Youth Protection Training, be sure and get it done quickly.</p>
