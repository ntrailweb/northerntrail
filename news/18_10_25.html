<p>Are you a new scout parent? We suspect your scout is really excited about scouting! Even if you have some experience with scouting, there is likely a lot about scouting that you don't know. Yes there have been some changes!</p>

<p>The best way to learn about the program is to come to training. We have volunteers who are old hands at scouting and will clarify many things you may be unsure about. Your child will benefit from your understanding of the program.</p>

<p>Your child is interested in scouting because of the fun, adventure and the opportunity to be with other children. What you might not have thought about very much, is why scouting is so important.</p>

<p>Scouting is preparation for life. The aims and methods of the program are designed to achieve these goals. It's a fact that youth who participate in scouts are better prepared for the challenges to come. Scouting is about values. It's much more than "entertainment." Any adult who spent time in scouting as a youth will tell you that it has had a profound impact on their life.</p>

<p>Your understanding and involvement will improve the chances of your child staying in scouting and benefiting from the program. </p> 

<p>Attending training does not imply any obligation to be a front line leader. Training is for every leader and PARENT. Even if you are not in a defined position, your help is needed at meetings and outings and your knowledge of the program will be an asset to the other leaders as well as your own scout. If you want your scout to get the most out of scouting all the way to Eagle, get trained and involved.</p>

<p>Get signed up today! Training is Saturday afternoon November 3rd. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/northern-trail-district-day-training">More information and registration.</a></p>
