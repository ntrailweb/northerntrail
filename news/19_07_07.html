<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Planning for the 2019-2020 Scout Year</strong></p>
<p>If you have not started planning scouting events and activities for the coming school year, there is no better time than now. A good place to begin is to take a look at the school calendar, district calendar and the council calendar. The best way to get great participation is to nail down the dates for your activities and start promoting them now. Speaking of promotion, now is a great time to work on getting your leaders trained. Every registered adult must have youth protection and front line leaders must be position trained. In addition to on-line training, the district offers in-depth hands-on training for scoutmasters and assistant scoutmasters which includes a campout. This training is not only for existing leaders, but parents who want to understand how to help their scout get the most out of the program. So make some plans and get the word out to members of your unit.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>BSA Parents</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://ntrail.org/images/BSA_parents.png" align="right">Have you heard of the newly formed organization BSA Parents?<br /> 
BSA Parents is a 501c(4) not-for-profit that was started by parents of Scouts and friends of the BSA. We started this organization to help tell the stories of Scouts and the important role Scouting plays in our communities and in our country. BSA Parents is made up of parents of Scouts and friends of the BSA. Anyone who believes in our mission and wants to help and/or share their story can do so here at BSAParents.com.</p>
<p>MISSION STATEMENT<br />
The mission of BSA Parents is to recruit, inform and amplify voices of those who believe:
<ul>
<li>That the Boy Scouts of America is a vital organization that plays an indispensable role in the formation of character and values in America’s youth.</li>
<li>That the Boy Scouts of America is invaluable to our communities.</li>
<li>That the Boy Scouts of America is a welcoming and inclusive organization that should live on and thrive for generations to come.</li>
<li>That the Boy Scouts of America has a social and moral responsibility to continue to protect youth and it needs to continue to live out this duty every day.</li>
</ul>
The Boy Scouts of America serves an invaluable purpose in building character and instilling values in America’s youth, and shaping the leaders of tomorrow. As parents, family members and friends of the BSA, pledge your support for this organization and the value that it brings to communities.</p>
