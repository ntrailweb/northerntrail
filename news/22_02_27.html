<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Volunteer or <span style=" font-style:italic;">Voluntold</span></strong></p>
<p>Scouting relies on the work of thousands of volunteers to deliver the program to our youth. Den Leaders, Cub Masters, Scoutmasters, Merit Badge Counselors and committee members are all examples of opportunities to help.</p>
<p>There is an old joke in scouting, "it's only an hour a week." In addition to taking more time, it also takes more than one individual leading the program.</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities to help. Volunteers are needed to drive to campouts, bake cookies for Blue & Gold banquets, serve as Walking Den Leaders for Twilight Camp, Popcorn Kernel or Camp Card Coordinator to name just a few.</p>
<p>No one likes it, but it is often necessary to resort to <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">voluntold.</span> How many times have you been at a meeting and heard the call for volunteers and no one steps up? Those leaders who do step up can't carry the load all by themselves. A hardworking leader put in this position will be discouraged by the silence. You don’t want discouraged leaders, discouraged leaders will fade away.
Volunteering in scouting is very rewarding and those of us who have done this a long time can tell you that it is satisfying, and we can see the difference we are making. However, we all get tired and discouraged when we don't have enough help.
Everyone has their obligations and limitations on time. We cannot have success without your help as the saying goes, "Many hands make light work." The next time you hear a call for help, please don't hesitate to step up and if you are <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">voluntold</span>, please cheerfully say "yes I will help."</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Camp Cards</strong></p>
