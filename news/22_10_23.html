<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Keeping the Fire Going</strong></p>
<p>Recently I was watching a YouTube video and in the video a person had just started a cooking fire when a friend approached. He said to the friend; ‚Äúthis is a young fire and I need to attend to it.‚Äù Those of us who have built fires would know exactly what he was trying to say. Getting a fire going takes planning and attention. You need to have your materials at hand, dry kindling, and a succession of materials appropriate. Going right from the kindling to a large log won‚Äôt usually work very well. You might get a lot of flame, but it will quickly burn away and go out. To make this work you need to feed the fire with larger and larger twigs and then sticks. Once these are going, you can carefully add the larger logs. All along you need to carefully fan the flames to get it going. When the larger logs start to burn, you can then relax a bit, the fire will take care of itself for a while, but it will still need attention.</p>
<p>A new unit is like that fire. In the beginning you need to start small and carefully manage the process. You can get a big burst of activity only to have it quickly fade. The trick is to keep it going with planning. Bringing on more youth and leaders will sustain the unit. You can then ‚Äúrelax‚Äù a little, but make sure your unit is getting the attention it needs or your unit will fade, just like that fire.</p>
<p>Think longer term. Plan out your entire scouting year in advance. You can always adjust as things change, but having a framework to work from will help keep your unit healthy and on track. If you need help, contact your unit commissioner. He or she can give you advice on how to keep the ‚Äúfire‚Äù going!

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Webelos Woods, November 4-6, 2022</strong></p>
<p>Webelos Woods is an awesome opportunity for Webelos (and their parents) to experience some of the fun that they can look forward to once they cross over into a troop. Troops will host Webelos Scouts from various packs and will form patrols which will include those Webelos Scouts for the weekend. Packs will be assigned to camp with a host Troop by the event staff.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the patrols will rotate in a round-robin style of activities where they can visit with different Troops. Each patrol will learn a variety of different outdoor and Scout skills and put them to use in live demonstrations. On Saturday night, both districts will come together to enjoy a rousing campfire program with yells and skits! There will also be a OA Brotherhood ceremony on Saturday evening.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Upcoming Roundtable</strong> </p>
<p>Date & Time: Thursday, November 10th @ 7:00 PM<br />
Place: First United Methodist Church Richardson (503 N Central Expy 1000, Richardson, TX 75080)<br />
<p>You might be asking yourself‚Ä¶ "Have there even been monthly roundtables in Northern Trail?" That being said, there is a reason you haven't heard a lot of talk about it throughout this year‚Ä¶ it's because we haven't consistently held it throughout the year due to past low attendance and interest. However, recently, we've been getting a lot of volunteer feedback that holding it (at least quarterly) would be really helpful for units to be more connected to their commissioner, surrounding units, and helps you "be in the know‚Äù on things happening seasonally. We're scheduling this for YOU to be more equipped and supported in how to lead your unit. This is a resource for you. And it is perfect timing as recharter is RIGHT around the corner and we want to help get you started. We'll give you instructions on "how to recharter," upcoming programs, and give you an opportunity to meet your commissioner (and if you haven't already‚Ä¶ me!) to get your questions answered. Please invite the adult in your unit spearheading the recharter process to attend as well.</p>
<p>For those that haven't heard of roundtable‚Ä¶ here's what it is: Roundtables provide unit leaders with the skill to do and the will to do what is needed to ensure that every member of every unit has a great Scouting experience. They build upon the foundation provided by position-specific basic training and each leader's commitment to serving youth through Scouting. It exists for the purpose of providing and capturing information, offering current program training, and provides networking opportunities.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there! üòä</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Service Opportunity</p>
<p>Greetings Scouters. Do you have Scouts or a unit that needs Service hours or a project ..or just wants to 'do a good turn' and be 'helpful'?</p>
<p>The Arlington Charities organization (<a href="https://www.arlingtoncharities.org/"><span style="font-weight:bold;">link</span></a>), a non-profit charitable organization that fights 'hunger, poverty and homelessness' has asked for help from Scouts. The Program Director is Casey McCollum, a legacy Eagle Scout from North Trail District. He has started a program asking for donations of usable sleeping bags to be distributed to those folks on the streets with no shelter and in real danger in the coming cold months.</p>
<p>If you and your Scouts are willing to help, please check your unit storage rooms, the trailer and even theirs and your own Scout storage closet for older, no longer used, or extra sleeping bags that could be a life saver for someone in need.</p>
<p>If you find such sleeping bags, please contact John McCollum at 214.497.5276 or <a href="mailto:jmccollum0@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">jmccollum0@gmail.com</span></a> and I will arrange for collection and transport to the Arlington shelter.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone.</p>
