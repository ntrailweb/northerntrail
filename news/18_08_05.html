<p><img align="left" hspace="10" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/ww_2018_small.png">Here is a great opportunity to get help up and coming Boy Scouts get a great launch into the Boy Scout program. Troops are needed to help staff this event. If you are interested in staffing, please attend the planning meeting in FUMC-R, room 225, 7-8:30 pm Aug. 15 and Sept. 12.
The theme for Webelos Woods is “Scout Skills”. Scout Troops are encouraged to volunteer for STAFF in the following areas: Compass, First Aid (making kits), Knife & Axe (safe use and cleaning), Dutch Oven Cooking, First Aid bandage ( using neckerchief), Tug- a-war, String Burning, Campsite inspections, and other events TBD.

Cost for event has been set at $10.00 for Cub and Cub Adult.
Cubs and Scout Troops provide their own food.
