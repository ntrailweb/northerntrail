		<p> <strong>June 5-9, 2023,</strong> Breckenridge Park, <strong>4:15 p.m.-8:30 p.m. daily</strong>. Twilight Camp is for Tigers, Cubs and Webelo scouts. This is a late afternoon, early evening event designed to be compatible with most work schedules, so minimal time off work is usually required. I've staffed more times than I can count, and can assure you that the scouts and adults always have a great time. 
The proof is in the pictures. Here are some from last year:</p><p style="margin-left:20px;">

The training includes campsite selection, outdoor event planning, parent involvement, health &amp; safety, equipment, cooking, and an introduction to camping skills.
						<br>
						<br>All Packs are required to have a minimum of one (more recommended) for any and all overnight events.

					<li> <strong>Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills (IOLS)</strong> provides adult leaders the practical outdoor skills they need to lead Scouts in the out-of-doors. Participants will works as Patrols at this hands-on training. Upon completion, leaders should feel comfortable teaching Scouts the basic skills required to obtain the First Class rank. All Troops are required to have IOLS trained leaders and all SM/ASMs are required to have it to be fully trained.
						<br>

			<li><strong>Wilderness First Aid</strong> Wilderness First Aid, a 16-hour class required for all High Adventures Treks, a minimum of two for Philmont and one for the others.

I have the following classes scheduled: <strong>Apr 14-16,</strong> and <strong>May 4-7</strong> at Trinity Bible Church, 400 Campbell Rd, Richardson. The cost is $85. Fri night, 6:30-10:30 pm; Sat 8 am - 4:30 pm; and Sun 12:30-4:30 pm CPR/AED is required and offered the Thursday before is class, at a cost of $40.
