<p>The deadline to nominate someone in your unit for a <span style="font-weight:bold;">Your Extraordinary Service, District Award of Merit</span> or the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Robert E. Little</span> award is <span style="font-weight:bold;">December 9th</span>. Please take a few minutes to consider adult leaders in your unit who should be recognized for their contributions to the success of your units. Without their dedication and service scouting could not function. The nomination process is not difficult. We have an online form for the <a href="http://ntrail.org/yes"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Y.E.S.</span></a> award which is designed to recognize leaders at the unit level. Forms for the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award may be found on the <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html#overlay-context="><span style="font-weight:bold;">website.</span></a></p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <a href="mailto:mzi@gatech.edu"><span style="font-weight:bold;">mzi@gatech.edu</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">District Awards Banquet</strong></p>
<p>The date for the dinner has been changed to February 23rd. COVID 19 put a real dent in our ability to recognize hard working volunteers and leaders in the district. In January we are planning to resume our annual district awards banquet. Expect a great meal, inspiring keynote speaker and a very enjoyable evening.

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p> 
<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>
<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p><p>Watch the <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/calendar-events"><span style="font-weight:bold;">calendar</span></a> and newsletter for information about available training.<p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone. Help is available, just ask!</p>
