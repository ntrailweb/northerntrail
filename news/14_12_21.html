<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I hope everyone is having a good December thus far and everyone is getting ready for the holidays. I am writing this email to you today for two reasons. The first one is on a more personal note. I have been offered and have accepted a job offer from the Lewisville TX Police Department as a Police Officer. I am going to be entering into the Police Academy on the 5th of January. So I will be stepping down as your District Executive for Northern Trail. My last official day will be Tuesday the 23rd of December. I applied to this position back in February so it was kind of a shock when they  finally called me. I know I have not had the opportunity to meet most of you but I know you are out there doing great things for the Boy Scouts. I wanted to thank everyone for welcoming me in with open arms even though I was brand new at this. It really made my life easier. It was an honor to work for the best District in Circle Ten Council. My Field Director and Boss Mr. Michael Hunt is working very hard to find my replacement. In the meantime if you need anything feel free to contact Mr. Hunt via email (Michael.hunt@scouting.org) or phone (214)-902-6743. He will be readily available to help in any way he can.</p>
<p>The second reason of this email is I wanted to wish you and your families a very Happy Holiday Season. You have all done so well in 2014 and I know you will do great things in 2015. Thanks for all that you do and keep up the good work!</p>
