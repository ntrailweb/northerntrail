<p>Cooking requirements for Cub Scouts can be lots of fun. Come earn your Bobcat rank and cook with us. Get information about upcoming events also.

<p>Longtime Northern Trail trainer, Mike Reisinger, is our guest speaker. He will be telling us about all the training available. There&rsquo;s a lot going beginning with Youth Protection training, and going on through to the University of Scouting and Wood Badge.</p>
<p>This is a discussion you will only hear at Roundtable. Come and meet other Scouters. Share ideas and information. We will have fun, fellowship, and we have great door prizes such as gift cards from Kenny&rsquo;s Italian Kitchen.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Leader Appreciation Luncheon at Camp Wisdom!, October 8th</strong></p>
<p>Mark your calendars for the Leader Appreciation Lunch October 8th at Camp Wisdom. We had just over 100 people attend last year to explore over 30 booths of program features within Circle Ten and our four outstanding area camps.</p>
<p>Each unit should choose two people to attend this luncheon in their honor. Suggested attendees are decision makers in the unit’s program. BALOO Trained adults, Cub Masters, Scout Master, Advisors, Skippers, Outdoor Committee Members, Senior Patrol Leaders, Crew Presidents, Boatswains, or any other leader that can use the information and needs to meet the people involved in all of these programs. </p>
<p>
This is sure to be another great event. Lunch is provided by the Order of the Arrow Bistro and a small token of appreciation for all the program planning these folks do will be given out as well. More information including a registration link to come. Questions – contact Kim Huff (<a href="mailto:kimhuffdcd@gmail.com">kimhuffdcd@gmail.com</a>). </p>
