<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Roundtable Schedule Change</strong></p>

<p>Roundtable will be held this "<strong>TUESDAY August 9th at 7:00PM.</strong>" This is a change in schedule from prior years. Going forward Roundtable will be held at the First United Methodist Church of Richardson, 503 N Central Expressway Room 212 in the Education Building. <strong><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dc9fpK3dbxS2">Map</a></strong> Roundtable is for all leaders and parents in all programs. Training, tips and information about all aspects of scouting is available. The Order of the Arrow meeting is held at the same location and time in Room 211.</p>

<p>The Boy Scout Roundtable this month will focus on "How To Do a Board of Review". District Advancement Chair, Bob Faulkner, is our guest speaker. The presentation and discussion are designed to help new parents and new leaders learn the process of a Board of Review. The boys have worked on rank advancements all summer. Now they're ready for their reviews. Often times, adults are reluctant to help with them because they do not know what to do. The shortage of adults willing to participate results in advancement delays and the boys to becoming discouraged. This introduction to the process will encourage everyone to be excited about volunteering. If you're new to Boy Scouts, been around a few years, or your one of the "old guys", your attendance is helpful and greatly appreciated.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Departure of Jesus Vazquez</strong></p>

<p>Our very hard working District Executive has accepted a new position and will be leaving Circle Ten. His last day in the office will be August 12th. We will miss Jesus and he will be difficult to replace. A search is under way and when a new executive is hired, we will make an announcement. In the interim, Michael Hunt will fill in until a replacement is hired. Michael may be reached at 214-902-6720 or <a href="mailto:Michael.Hunt@scouting.org">Michael.Hunt@scouting.org</a>. 

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub-a-Palooza (Northern Trail to Adventure)</strong></p>

<p>Save the date, Saturday October 1st, all day. Note a change from the date presented at Program Preview. This is a family Cub Scout Event held at Camp Wisdom. Lot of fun in Cub world and special events for the entire family. More details will be available soon.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Popcorn</strong></p>

<p>REGISTER FOR POPCORN KERNEL TRAINING TODAY!!! We have three more training sessions for Popcorn Kernels on Aug. 9, 11 and 13. You will need to register for and attend one of these “batting practices” this week. Before you can attend a training session, you must first register your pack/troop/team for popcorn sales. Visit the Council website to sign up, for additional details and for critical dates at circleten.org/popcorn.</p>
<p>In addition, you won’t want to miss out on an opportunity to attend the exciting and motivating Michael Beck Sales Training, to be held at AMC Valley View 16 on Thursday, August 18. Selling popcorn is easy with the right training and support, and achieving high popcorn sales goals will help fund both your unit operations and the Council’s programming. Selling popcorn also teaches Scouts the value of contributing their time and effort to making the Scouting program the best it can be. Register TODAY!</p>
<p>If you have any questions about popcorn sales or training, please contact your District Popcorn Kernels Patti and Trey Otte at 214.405.4718 (Patti) or 214.402.4718 (Trey). We are looking forward to working with you.

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Second Annual Outdoor Adventure</strong></p>

<p>Mark your Calendar; Saturday September 10, 2016, Yale Park, <a href="http://ow.ly/IZ6F302EEdm">Map</a></p>
<p>Help us kick off our Fall recruiting by participating in the 2nd Annual Outdoor Adventure community event! Northern Trail District and the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas are sponsoring a family day at the park for people residing in the Richardson Independent School District. Last year we had over 25 activities and hundreds of families around the Richardson area enjoying a fun-filled day of games and scout skills.</p>
<p>This event is a wonderful opportunity to promote your pack, troop or crew and demonstrate how much fun it is to be a Scout! If you would like to sponsor and staff an activity, the signup form is now available <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/outdoor-adventure-activity-signup">here.</a></strong> If you have any questions, please email Marjie Price at <a href="mailto:msmn1204@gmail.com">msmn1204@gmail.com</a>. </p>
<p>View and share our video from last year’s event: <a href="https://youtu.be/wJYKc-GAk5U">youtu.be/wJYKc-GAk5U</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fall Training, Mark your Calendar</strong></p>

<p>Training dates have been posted to the calendar. If you have leaders who lack training, please insure that they allocate the time to attend training. Training is not just for front line leaders. Parents who want their scout to get the most out of the program, should attend training and learn just how the scouting program works. Training will make your job easier and you will get much better results. <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/fall-training">More information</a></strong></p>
