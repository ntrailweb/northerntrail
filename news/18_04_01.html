<p>Both the Boy Scouts of American and the State of Texas are committed to protecting our youth. As adult scouters we must be in full compliance with both groups. New requirements from National means that all registered adult scouters must take the updated on-line training by October 1, 2018. Please see the <a href="http://circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/new_ypt2_update_quick_facts.pdf">Quick Facts</a> for more detailed information.</p>
 
<p>This does not replace F2F, but is in <span style="font-weight:bold;">addition</span> to F2F if that is the only training you receive for YPT. As you know, F2F is required for any long-term camp (more than 72 hours).</p>

<p>Get out there and sell Camp Cards. Please make sure you are signed up to sell at booth sales, but do not forget the good old fashion of selling via your network of family, friends, neighbors, and scout leaders. Make sure that every time a scout sells 25 cards, they are entered into the weekly drawing. Each 25 gets a new entrance. Good Luck and keep selling! May 11th is last day to turn in money and unsold camp cards to the scout offices.<br />Deborah DiStasi, <a href="mailto:deborahdistasi@gmail.com">deborahdistasi@gmail.com</a>, 972-644-4225

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friends of Scouting</strong></p>
<p>Everyone can help make scouting a financial success. Even a small amount makes a difference. Northern Trail is falling behind other districts and has only achieved about 45% of our goal.</p>
<p>Please consider the value of scouting to our community. Both the volunteer labor and the financial support come from our local community and we don't receive any funds from National.</p>
<p>Don't put it off any longer, if you've already made a pledge this year, <b>Thank You.</b> If you have not, just go to <a href="http://circleten.org/give-now">http://circleten.org/give-now</a> and click the Donate button. <span style="color:black; font-weight:900;font-style:italic;">When you get to the donation screen, be sure and identify your gift in the "Note" field. For example "Northern Trail Troop 9999."</span> Scouting works because of you!</p>
