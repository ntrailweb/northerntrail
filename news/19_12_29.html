<p>If you have completed your unit re-charter, Thank You! If not it's time to 
<strong>Get 'er Done!</strong> As of December 31st your unit will become "inactive" and scouts can't advance and your unit can't use the council facilities. Please take the time to complete the needed paperwork.</p>

<p>These units have submitted their recharter (as of 12/26/19): Crew 719, Crew 890, Pack 435, Pack 516, Pack 570, Pack 719, Pack 728, Pack 890, Pack 893, Pack 894, Pack 1077, Pack 2060, Troop 81, Troop 86, Troop 435, Troop 444B, Troop 444G, Troop 570, Troop 707, Troop 719, Troop 728B, Troop 728G, Troop 751, Troop 777, Troop 890B, Troop 890G, Troop 1001, Troop 1077, Troop 2054, and Troop 2060. That is only 30 units. There are 8 units that have begun the recharter. This means there are 15 units that have not started the online recharter process and you have only two days to complete the process.</p>


<p>Adult leaders, you must have a current youth protection card for your unit to complete your registration. These expire every two years. Take the online course at <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a></p>
