<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection Training is Required</strong></p>
<p>No excuses, get it done today. You can't be a part of the program without a current card. Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter, Get 'er Done!</strong></p>
<p>In September someone in your unit should have received information on how to log in to the recharter system. Logging in is the first step in the process. Every unit should have logged in by now. Unfortunately, this hasn’t happened and only five Northern Trail units have actually begun the recharter process.</p>
<p>Next, is comparing your unit’s roster with your records. If you are using ScoutBook, both should be in sync. If you are using a third-party program, you have two choices-uploading your roster or downloading the roster from the recharter website. This is a crucial step because you don’t want to leave someone off inadvertently or pay the registration fee for someone who is long gone. This applies to both youth and adults (to BSA adults are anyone over age 18).</p>
<p>At this point your unit should be reviewing its roster and making sure that all adults who will be registered have current Youth Protection Training. Youth Protection Training is good for two years. In 2018 YPT was updated and everyone needed to take it by October 2018, so right now 1/3 of Northern Trail leaders have expired YPT. If there are any adults in your unit who are in that position now is the time to strongly encourage (harangue) them to go online and update their YPT.</p>

<p>More on the recharter process next week. To summarize: Log into the recharter system and purify you unit’s rosters both youth and adult. Be sure your adults all have current YPT.</p>

<p>There is a re-charter clinic on Wednesday Novermber 4th at 6:00PM on Zoom. Bring your questions.<br />

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">New Friends of Scouting Chair</strong></p>
<p>Trey Otte has accepted the position as the Friends of Scouting Chair for Northern Trail District. While we don't like to think about it, the financial health of the council is a essential element which makes scouting possible in our district. This is a big job and Trey will be calling members of the district to help him achieve the financial goals for the district. Please help him out in this important role.</p>
<p>Trey is as an Assistant Scoutmaster for Troop 1001. Trey Otte began his Scouting career almost forty years ago in the Galveston area at Bay Area Council. He was a Cub Scout in Pack 203 and a Boy Scout in Troop 244, both of which were based in LaMarque, Texas. Trey earned the rank of Eagle Scout with a Silver Palm. In addition, he was extremely active in the Order of the Arrow and was bestowed the Vigil Honor back in 1987. He served as the 50th Anniversary Lodge Chief for Wihinipa Hinsa Lodge #113, where his leadership in cheerful service to others earned him the OA Founder’s Award in 1989.</p>
<p>As an adult, Trey rekindled his Scouting Spirit here in Circle Ten Council. He joined Pack 262 in Richardson when his son Will started Scouting back in 2008. He served the Pack in various capacities, including Treasurer and Assistant Cubmaster, until the Spring of 2013. Trey has spent the last several years with Troop 1001 serving on their Troop Committee, as a Patrol Advisor and Assistant Scoutmaster, and he retired from a three-year stint as Scoutmaster in June of this year. He has served his district as Popcorn Kernel and the Council as Cub Camping Chair and Summer Camp Staff Trainer. He helped develop the Strictly for Cubmasters Course at the University of Scouting, and he co-chaired a Train-o-ree in October 2016 at Camp Wisdom. These contributions led to him earning the District Award of Merit in January 2017.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, Trey discovered his love for the Wood Badge program when he took the course as a participant (scratch that…as a MIGHTY ANTELOPE) back on Wood Badge 108. He served as a Troop Guide on Wood Badge 112, ASM of Facilities on Wood Badge 120, AQM on Wood Badge 128 and will be SPL for Wood Badge 135 in February 2021. When he is not Scouting or helping his wife Patti with her ice cream business, Trey and his family love to travel. His day job at Southwest Airlines has helped to make both his travel dreams (and his Scouting expenses) affordable.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">IOLS Training a Great Success</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to Bram Franklin and his staff on the great IOLS course! They had a great outdoor session while being completely COVID-19 compliant. It can be done!</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Eagle Applications and Paperwork</strong></p>
<p>Open Letter to Troop Eagle Advisors, Scoutmasters, and Committee Chairs in Northern Trail.</p>
<p>Over the years, as one of your District Eagle Designees, I have seen ebbs and flows in the quality of paperwork submitted by, or on behalf, of the Eagle Candidates. Lately, I have seen a growing number of items which can be easily and quickly corrected to improve the quality of the information we are reviewing in the Eagle Board of Review (EBoR).</p>
<p>It all boils down to you guiding your Scouts to read thoroughly, and follow the instructions carefully, as provided in the Eagle Application and the Eagle Scout Service Project Workbook. </p>
<p>These seem, I am sure, trivial in the grand scheme of things, until you consider this is about a Scout achieving the Eagle Scout Rank. It is really another level above what you expect the “average scout” to accomplish. We have a phenomenal legacy here in the Northern Trail District and every new Eagle should be bringing their “A” game when they are going through the reviews for this rank. </p>
<p>That said, some of the things I have noticed lately: Scouts do not follow the instructions, on the Eagle application, for Requirements 3 and 6. </p>
<p>For requirement number 3, simply cross off the non-applicable Merit Badges as the instructions indicate.</p>
<p>On Requirement 6, sign, date, and provide a contact phone number for yourself. Also, provide a “listing of positions held in your religious institution, school, camp, community, or other organizations, during which you demonstrated leadership skills.” Please notice, the idea here is to understand what you do outside of scouts. Including your scout leadership and such is fine, but the requirement calls for the other things you do which sets you apart from your classmates and friends. </p>
<p>There are plenty of gotchas in the Project Workbook which I would like to cover in another installment of this letter. </p>
<p>Here is the part where we, as adult leaders, can help our scouts: Someone in the Troop should be assisting the Scout in filling out all this paperwork and reviewing the final work products. Simply sitting down with the Scout during a meeting (or before/after the meeting) for a few minutes, regularly, and reviewing the paperwork can go a long way towards improving the quality of these applications and Project Workbooks. After you have seen 2 or 3 in a row, you start to really know what to look out for and you can point these out to the Scout. Let them make the corrections but make sure the paperwork is golden. </p>
<p>Thank you. Northern Trail District has this rich history of Eagle Scouts and every one of them have cause to be proud of their accomplishments. We can help them learn even more about attention to detail and pride of workmanship in making their application for this rank be the best it can be.</p>
