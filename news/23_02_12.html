<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Leadership Burn-out </strong> </p>

<p>One of the most common issues we hear, particularly from new leaders, is that "no one will help, and I am overwhelmed."  Running a unit can be a lot of work.  The old saying "many hands make light work" is true. The problem is getting the many hands working the tasks.  We are all busy and finding time is difficult. Everyone is concerned about taking on a task they can't complete. It's easy to just say "I don't have time."</p>
<p>There are some strategies to break down the resistance. First, specific tasks which are clearly limited in scope are easier to get help with. For example, asking someone to be a den leader is a big step, asking someone to demonstrate a skill such as knot tying for example is a better place to start. "We have an outing on Saturday, can you help transport scouts to this event?"</p>
<p>You must make personal direct requests for help. Just asking a group of parents at a meeting if someone can help with a particular task is not going to work very well if at all. You may have to ask several times, but persistence pays off.</p>
<p>Allow your new volunteer the flexibility and opportunity to add their own ideas and vision to the problem. Micromanagement is generally a bad idea and won't get good results. Additionally your help will likely have ideas you have not even thought of.</p>
<p>Perfect is the enemy of the good!  Don't get burned out, divide, and conquer.  Ask for help and keep asking until you get it!</p>
