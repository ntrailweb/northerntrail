		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Community Service and Passive Recruiting</strong></p>

		<p>Recently I read an <a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2023/01/09/passive-recruiting-what-it-is-and-how-you-can-make-it-work-for-you/"><strong>article</strong></a> in Scouting Magazine about passive recruiting.  Another good reason for your unit to participate in community service projects.  Years ago when my boys were in scouts, our unit would sing holiday carols each year at a nursing home. The scouts would bring their band instruments and they would do their best to sing. We'd bring cookies and some punch. The scouts would visit with the residents and we always had a good time.  One year for whatever reason we did not go and the following year we were told that they were so looking forward to our annual visit and were quite disappointed when we did not come. Clearly we made a lot of very positive impressions in spite of our mediocre musical ability&#128521;</p>
		
		<p>As the article points out events like these often lead to new scouts for your unit. Sometimes in very indirect paths.</p>

		<p>Community service is a part of being a scout, it's part of the oath and law. In addition to teaching your scouts what it means to be a scout, it can also lead to new scouts for your unit. Part of community service is making the gift of scouting available to youth in your community. The first step is awareness of the program and why it's a good thing.</p>
		
		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">District Awards Banquet</strong></p>

		<p>The date for the dinner has been changed to <strong>February 23, 2023.</strong> COVID 19 put a real dent in our ability to recognize hard working volunteers and leaders in the district. In January we are planning to resume our annual district awards banquet. Expect a great meal, inspiring keynote speaker and a very enjoyable evening. </p>

		<p>The event will be held at First United Methodist Church, Richardson, 501 North Central Expressway.
