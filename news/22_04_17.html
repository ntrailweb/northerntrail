<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Twilight Camp 2022</strong> </p>
<p>Where can Cub Scouts have fun and work on advancement at the same time? The answer is simple—at the Wild, Wild West Twilight Camp. Northern Trail will be having Twilight Camp at Richardson’s Breckenridge Park from June 6-10.</p>
<p>Twilight Day Camp is for Cub and Webelos Scouts and is a late afternoon, early evening activity making it available to working parents. Activities start at 4:30pm and runs through 8:30pm each day. Lots of activities including crafts, BB-guns, archery, games, crafts and scout skills. We will have the ever-popular egg drop contest. Registration for both scouts and adult leaders is now available. <span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTDayCamp">https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTDayCamp</a></span></p><p>If you have a Cub Scout attending Twilight Camp, we need your participation too. The easiest way is to serve as a Walking Den Leader. A Walking Den Leader is just that, a wrangler who rides herd over 8 Cubs, moseying them over from activity to activity. You’ll cast your gander on a wide range of Cub Scout activities and get a first look at a craft project that might just become a family treasure.</p>
<p>There are Camp staff positions as well both adult and junior. Sign up using the link above.</p>
