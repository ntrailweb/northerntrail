<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">New Years Resolutions</p>
<p>It's that time of year again when we reflect on the past and look forward to the future. Many of us make New Year's resolutions, but sometimes it's hard to stay on track.  The key is to set realistic goals and check in on your progress throughout the year.  A good way to do this is to set reminders in your calendar.</p>
<p>This year, focus on setting some specific scouting goals.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge your scouts to set specific goals like:</strong>
Earning specific merit badges, or maybe even start planning an Eagle Scout project? Suggest they write down their goals and break them down into smaller steps.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders and Parents:</strong> Step up your involvement! There are countless  ways to contribute! Consider serving on the unit committee, providing transportation to events, helping plan a Court of Honor, or assisting with a Blue and Gold banquet. You could also lend a hand with the Pinewood Derby. Every bit of help makes a difference!</p>
<p><strong>Training is Key:</strong> One of the most important things you can do this year is to complete the training for your position. Even if you're not in a direct leadership role, training helps you understand the Scouting program better. This will put you in a stronger position to support your Scout and help them achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
