<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Worried about Restarting Unit Meetings Safely?</strong></p>
<p>It can be done, here is a video recording of a recent webinar explaining the process: <a href="https://vimeo.com/475878258">Getting Restarted Video</a></p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html">Recognize Adult Scouters</a> <span style="font-style:italic;">Deadlines fast approaching</span></strong></p>
<p>Scouting only exists due the tireless work of volunteers and the unit, district, council and national level. We are indebted to these individuals who are critical to the success of the scouting movement.</p>
<p>Please take the time to nominate hard working scouters for recognition. A formal recognition is a tangible way to demonstrate to these individuals that their efforts are truly appreciated. Being appreciated is an energizing process and we need energized volunteers to energize scouting.</p>
<p>The Silver Beaver deadline is at hand, <strong>November 19th</strong>, district and unit award nominations must be completed by <strong>December 12th</strong>. These are <strong>hard</strong> deadlines. More information may be found <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html#overlay-context=">here.</a>.

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter Deadlines Fast Approaching</strong></p>
<p>Every unit should be working on their re-charters. If you are a member, make sure you have a current YPT card and have submitted any fees and or paperwork to your district chair. We continue to see units which have not started the process. Rather than running down information and nagging, our leaders would rather work on delivering the program. Please don't wait until last minute to get started. Please help avoid the pain, get started today.</p>
<p>November 12th- Re-charter turn-in in has been changed to the Roundtable location in the parking lot just west and across Custer Rd from the First United Methodist Church. Bring your re-charter documents and enjoy Roundtable, a win-win!<br />

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable Trunk or Treat?</strong></p>
<p>No, not a late Halloween event, our November Roundtable will feature our “Cooking with Northern Trail Thanksgiving Special.” We will be setting up in person and online on Thursday, November 12 in the west parking lot (across Custer Road) of First United Methodist Church Richardson for a practical demonstration of making a traditional Thanksgiving dinner using Dutch oven cookery. This Roundtable special event is for all adult leaders-Cub Scouts, Scouts BSA, Venturing and Sea Scouts.</p>
<p>So, join us on November 12 at 7:30 P.M. and learn some Dutch oven cooking tricks, enjoy fellowship with other Scouters and maybe get some samples.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership is a Year Round Activity</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" hspace="5" src="https://ntrail.org/images/join_cub_scouts.jpg">Scouting only works with a continuous progression, scouts join they advance, move on and new scouts join. Without new members, new potential scouts won't benefit from the program. Allowing your unit to dwindle and die, is not fair to those who came before you who worked so hard to create the program you have enjoyed. Take the time to recruit and keep your unit strong and healthy ready to serve the next generation of scouts.</p>
<p>Our Northern Trail membership committee is working hard to help you achieve these goals. Please participate in these efforts.</p></p>
<p>Every Scouting family should have a <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">yard sign</a>, either Cub Specific or generic. Yard signs will demonstrate that Scouting is thriving in Northern Trail.</p>
