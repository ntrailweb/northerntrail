<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Attend Summer Camp</strong></p>
<p>Summer camp is an essential component of your scouts development.  I have wonderful vivid memories of my summer scout camp experiences which occurred decades ago.  For many scouts, summer camp is the first time away from home for an extended length of time. This is an opportunity to learn some life skills in dealing with new situations and different support structures. Camp also provides the opportunity to earn merit badges and have some great fun at the same time. If you troop is not going to summer camp, your scout can still participate.  The Maverick scout program makes this possible. </p>
<p><strong>Maverick Camp at Circle Ten Summer Camps</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that Scouts can attend Circle Ten Summer Camp without your whole troop going?</p>
<p>Whether a Scout is wanting more summer camp than they can get with your troop, need a few more merit badges, their schedule conflicts with your summer camp offerings, or parents are not comfortable sending them far away, a Scout can attend any session of Summer Camp at either Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp or Camp Constantin/Jack D Furst Aquatic’s Base. They will camp together with other Scouts in the same situation and have staff assigned to serve as their Scoutmaster’s for the week.</p>
<p>To register, visit the camp registration page below and register them as a Maverick. If an adult would like to go with their scout, they can register as well.<br />
