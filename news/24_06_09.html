<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Hazardous Weather Training Required</strong></p>
<p>All direct contact leaders must have completed Hazardous Weather Training to be positioned trained. This includes Cub Scout, Scouts BSA and Venturing leaders.</p>
<p>This training and much more is available at <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> and takes about an hour to complete. I've taken the course and can report that has some great information and will make you better prepared to protect your scouts and yourself from weather related hazards. Having a clear plan of action is vital for positive outcomes. </p>
