<p>Dear Webelos Leaders and Pack Masters,</p>
<p>We have been working hard with several scout troops over the past few weeks to give your Webelos and their parents or guardians the opportunity to be involved in the upcoming  Webelos Woods program the weekend of <strong>September 28-29.</strong> All the troops that have some of their senior scouts and Adult leaders participating, are looking forward to the opportunity to serve your Webelos. Every Boy Scout Troop represented is very motivated to make it a successful weekend since last yearâ€™s event was regrettably cancelled.</p>
<p>For many Webelos and their accompanying adults, this will be their first opportunity to meet Boy Scout Troops and the beginning of seeing the larger picture of scouting beyond the Cub Scout program. We also have put together activities to help your Webelos on various advancements as well as participate in BB gun shooting and archery on our biggest scout camp in Circle 10 Council at Trevor Rees Jones.</p>

<p>More information and to sign-up for this event maybe found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/webelos-woods-6">here.</a></p>
<p>Early bird pricing ends Monday September 17th. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact the team at: <a href="mailto:webelos_woods@ntrail.org">webelos_woods@ntrail.org</a></p>  

<p>On a personal note, all three of my sons, the two oldest earned their Eagle and my youngest is about to earn his as well, thoroughly enjoyed their weekends at Webelos Woods when they were transitioning to Boy Scouts and were even more excited to cross over when their time came.</p>
