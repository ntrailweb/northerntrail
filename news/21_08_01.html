<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>"I learned so much…from other scouters." This is what is heard over and over at the completion of Adult Leader Training Courses. Yes, Northern Trail offers excellent training courses every spring and fall. We have Adult Leader Training and Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills (IOLS) for BSA Scout Leaders, Position Specific Training and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation (BALOO) for Cub Scout Leaders and Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops (ILST) for Scouts BSA youth.</p>
<p>Each course teaches valuable skills to help run successful Scouting programs. We say, “every scout deserves a trained leader.” We offer the blueprints to run successful troop and pack meetings and the tools to have the outdoor programs that will have our youth wanting to participate and stay engaged in scouting.
But aside from learning how to be an effective coach, mentor and leader, you get the opportunity to learn how other units run their programs. The exposure to how others approach the same issues you may face in your unit may be the most valuable asset of our training programs.</p>
<p>Please consider signing up for our Cub and Scouts BSA training programs. If you have taken these courses, maybe it’s time to take more advance training. Circle Ten offers Wood Badge leadership training, Powder Horn High Adventure Training, and BAT-Back Country Advanced Training. For those who enjoyed Wood Badge, consider Scouts BSA’s Philmont Leadership Challenge.</p>
There’s a wealth of knowledge out there, all you have to do is take the first step. Sign up for training!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Adult Leader specific training</span> will be offered in one session on Saturday October 16th at the John D. Murchison Scouting Center 8605 Harry Hines Blvd. Dallas, TX 75235. This course is designed for Scouts BSA leaders and parents. You will learn how a scout unit functions by participating as a scout would.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills</span> training for Scouts BSA leaders will occur the weekend of October 23-24, 2021, at Camp Wisdom. 7:30am Saturday through 12:00pm on Sunday. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BALOO, Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation</span> for Cub Scout and Webelos leaders will be held the weekend of October 23-24 at Camp Wisdom. 7:30am Saturday through 12:00pm on Sunday.</p> 
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cub Scout Leader Specific Training</span>. Course will be October 9 at Camp Wisdom, 9am-1pm.

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">District Committee</strong></p>
<p>A district in the scouting program is usually a geographical area within a council which services the scouting units within that area. Northern Trail covers the same geographical area as the Richardson Independent School District. This includes most of Richardson, portions of North Dallas and Garland. The committee is made of up volunteers and in our case one professional scouter. The committee is led by a chair, district commissioner and the scouting professional. This group of individuals is commonly referred to as the "key three." Within the committee are a number of functions, however the essential role of the district committee is help units within the district deliver the scouting program to the youth of the district.</p>
<p>Within the committee are a several functional groups which address particular activities. I have already mentioned the district commissioner who leads a group of assistants and individual unit commissioners who mentor unit leaders directly. Other key positions are membership, training, advancement, program, fund raising, health and safety, camping, adult recognition and the Order of the Arrow.</p>
<p>These volunteers work tirelessly behind the scenes to help make our district successful. Membership on the committee is open to any scouter who is willing to volunteer their time and talent. Contact the district Chair if you are interested in volunteering.</p><p>Regular meetings are normally held on the first Tuesday of the month and are open to any leader or parent in the district.</p> 

<p>Our next district committee meeting will be held on Tuesday August 3rd, 7:00PM at First United Methodist Church of Richardson - Room 230 A/B in the Education Building.</p>
