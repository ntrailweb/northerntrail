<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>School Night For Scouting</strong></p>
<p>This is the time of year that we focus on recruiting. Our scouts grow up and move on to adulthood and it's critical that new scouts come in to replace them. With new scouts come new parents and from these new parents a new generations of leaders. To keep delivering the promise of scouting we must recruit!  School rallies are now being scheduled and every unit will need to help with the new recruits. If you have questions, please contact Jorge Salazar <a href="mailto:Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org">Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org</a> (214)-738-3418.</p>
