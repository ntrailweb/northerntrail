<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>You Have a Mentor</strong></p>

<p>Every scout unit in Northern Trail has a district resource who is responsible for helping make your unit successful. If you have a question or a problem you don't know how to handle, he or she can lend their deep scouting experience and give you solid advice. Unit commissioners are the "old hands" who have been involved in scouts for many years. They not only have dwelt with many of the problems you are facing, they are enthusiastic about scouting and want to share their knowledge.  Regardless of need, the Unit Commissioners can facilitate a resolution. You can find out who your UC is on the Northern Trail web site at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners">northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners</a></p>

<p>If you need more assistance, contact the district commissioner Joe Tavares. <a href="mailto:tavares.joseph@gmail.com">tavares.joseph@gmail.com</a>, 214-675-4378.</p>

<p>Twilight Camp would not be possible without parents and grandparents who volunteer to help with the event. These Walking Den Leaders attend camp and walk with the scouts from station to station. It&#39;s not difficult and it&#39;s fun. You only need to be present during camp each day from&nbsp;4pm until 8pm. If you can&#39;t come every day you can come part of the time. The challenge for the organizers is to have enough den leaders each day. Training, including Face to Face Youth Protection for walking den leaders, will be held in May. The dates are May 4, 18, and 25 from 7pm to 9 pm in Room 205 at First United Methodist Church in Richardson (503 N. Central Expressway, Richardson, TX 75080). All questions will be answered! Please bring your completed Medical forms A &amp; B to the training. You may also mail your completed forms to: <a href="mailto:registrar@ntrail.org">registrar@ntrail.org</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>The Cub Scout Angle End of Year Cub Scout Advancement</strong></p>

<p><i>From the May-June Advancement News from BSA</i>
<p>The Cub Scout year of rank advancement is often geared to finish at the blue and gold banquet in February. The timing is ideal for a large banquet and festivities to celebrate advancement for all boys and signal the time for Webelos Scouts to complete their transition to Boy Scouting and troop involvement. Many Cub Scouts are unable to complete their rank advancement by this time, and are encouraged to continue working on adventures and electives. Some, however, do not complete their rank advancement by June 1, the traditional date when records change and each rank moves up—for example, Tiger becomes Wolf and Wolf becomes Bear. What happens to those boys who have been working but are not there yet? The answer is in the Guide To Advancement, topic 4.1.0.4, which allows the pack committee to allow a few extra weeks after the end of the school year. The Cub Scout should not have to “stop cold”—he deserves the chance to succeed and the GTA ensures this chance. The pack committee should meet during early May and get input from den leaders, parents, and Scouts. They should review advancement reports and see the health of the dens. Den leaders can identify boys who are finished, near to being finished, and those who are not as far in their advancement. Once those boys are identified, joint effort can be initiated to encourage and facilitate the successful completion of this Scout’s badge of rank. This will give him the all-important sense of accomplishment and pride in a job well done. Then it’s on to the next new Cub Scout advancement adventures.</p>
