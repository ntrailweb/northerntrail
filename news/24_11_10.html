<p><strong>Roundtable, Thursday November 14th, 7:00PM FUMC</strong></p>
<p>Roundtable will address the training manager function of <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>.</p> 
<p>Training is a critical part of the scouting program. Leaders must be position trained and complete a number of required training items many of which are available online.</p>
<p>All of your training is recorded and tracked online via <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. Roundtable will address navigating the training manager to ensure that your training records are accurate and complete.</p>
	
<p><strong>Camping a Core Scouting Method</strong></p>	
<p>Regular monthly campouts should be a part of every Scouts BSA program. Campouts serve several purposes. Scouts are expected to plan and prepare for these outings during patrol meetings. During the actual campout, scouts are expected to set up camp, prepare meals and organize activities.</p>
<p>Will all of these activities go to plan? Of course not! However with repetition the scouts will gain skills and master not only the ones needed for successful activities, they will learn to cope with the unexpected, be challenged and expand their horizons.</p>
<p>Get out there and go camping!</p>

<p>Here is something a little different. Celebrate Thanksgiving at home and then head out to camp for the remainder of the fall break.</p>
<p>Campsgiving is an opportunity to experience Camp Consstantin while enjoying some mild weather. Scouts will work on merit badges, enjoy evening programming, and meals are provided! Registration closes Wednesday, November 13 at 11:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA Troops, Venturing Crews, and Sea Scout Ships.  It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.</p>
<p>Units camp jamboree style with multiple units in a single campsite. The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards. Food is prepared by each unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ). <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024WinterCamp"><strong>More Information.</strong></a>
