<p>It is with a heavy heart, but full of gratitude for his service and that of his family as well that I must share the passing of one of our loyal leaders, Kevin Henson on November 7, 2019. As you know Kevin was very passionate about scouting as a merit badge counselor for many merit badges serving in Troop 100 in Garland and with Troop 728 Girls. Kevin is survived by his wife Julie, her son Kenneth, an Eagle Scout from Troop 100 who is now a Marine at Offutt AB, NE and their daughter Kimberly who is a scout in Troop 728 Girls. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/passing-kevin-henson">Continue reading</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-recharter-time">Unit Re-charter Time</a></strong></p>

<p>Now is the time to work on the annual re-charter. If you are a scout parent, be sure and get your paperwork and any fees to your unit leadership as soon as possible. If you are the unit chair, now is the time to pull together the information you need to complete the process.</p>

<p>Everyone else needs to support the process by completing the needed paperwork, submitting your fees and completing your youth protection training. Unit leaders should collect Background Check forms from every adult even ones who are primary elsewhere. This includes youth participants 18 years and older. Please donâ€™t wait until the last minute! Don't forget, membership fees have increased. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-recharter-time">More information and forms.</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong> Deadlines approaching!</p>
<p><i>Silver Beaver Deadline:</i> <b>November 17, 2019</b></p>
<p>Scouting is possible only because of the tireless work of countless volunteers. You will find these volunteers in your unit, organizing events, helping with activities and working directly with the youth. They are the parents, committee members, Den Leaders, Scout Leaders and Venturing Advisers. Beyond the unit at the district level are volunteers who mentor unit leaders as unit commissioners. District volunteers also work to offer training and district activities. Other volunteers work to help start new units and recruit new scouts. Then there are those who work on the critical task of raising the need funds for council operations. At the council level, volunteers serve in many of the same capacities but at a larger scale.</p>
<p>It is fitting that we recognize these volunteers at all levels and a mechanism is in place to do just that. At the unit level we have the Y.E.S. award which recognizes volunteers in individual units. At the district level we have the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Finally at the council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Nominations come from the scouting community and that means you. Please take a minute and review the awards and consider someone you know who should be recognized. More information and nomination forms may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">here</a>.

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Website Changes Coming</strong></p>
<p>As most of you have noticed, the council website has moved to a new platform and system. We continue to operate on the old platform, but will need to move to the new platform. Like moving into to a new house, this is an opportunity to do some clean-up and eliminate things which are no longer needed. We can also add missing items as well.</p><p>The communications team is looking for suggestions to help with this process. We have two fundamental goals, the first goal is make everyone aware of opportunities for scouts in the district with timely announcements of upcoming events and news items of interest to the scouting community in Northern Trail. The second goal is to create an on-line presence where the community can go and quickly find information about the same events and news in addition to finding contact information for district volunteers. Please take a moment and let us know what you think is important and what we should keep and what we should let go. As always ideas on how we can be more effective are always welcome.
