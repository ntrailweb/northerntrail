<p>Not participated in Camporee in several years?  Now is the time to re-introduce your scouts to Camporee.  Northern Trail and the old North Trail District have a long history of great Camporees.  I've attended many of them and the energy is always high and the scouts really enjoy it.  The weather should be great for camping.  It's a perfect time to become familiar with one of Circle Ten's great camps that you may not have visited in a while.  

This event is less than a month away.  Take this opportunity to showcase your troop to Webelos scouts by inviting them to camp with your troop.  It's also an opportunity to see how other troops organize their camps and compare notes with other unit leaders. Weekend of March 23-25, 2018 at Camp James Ray. The theme this year is Shipwrecked.  Activities: Scout Master/Delegate Dutch Oven Chili cook off,
SPL/Delegate Dutch Oven desert cook off, Sarsaparilla Run, Archery, Rifle Shooting and more! Expect a great event and lots of fun for everyone. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nl/2018_camporee_leader_guide.pdf">Leaders Guide</a> and unit registration now available.
