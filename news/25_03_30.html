<p style="font-size:1.7em; font-weight:bold;">Serve Scouting at the District Level</p>
<p style="clear:left;">Scouting thrives due to the work of volunteers. Within our own units we have Scoutmasters, Cubmasters, Den leaders, committee members and many others who work tirelessly to bring the promise of scouting to our children.  
Volunteers on the <strong>District Committee</strong> work on programs, membership, training, communications, and finance. The committee meets once a month to coordinate and plan these functions within the district.
The <strong>Commissioner Staff</strong> supports units by mentoring unit leaders and hosting roundtables to help unit leaders learn how to deliver a successful and fun program which will keep scouts engaged.
As our district continues to grow and evolve, we need fresh energy and innovative ideas to keep things running smoothly. If you are passionate about Scouting, your skills and experience can make a real impact.
The best way to learn more about district operations and the opportunities to volunteer is by attending a district committee or commissioner staff meeting.  Check with the chair, Lester Cox if you have questions. Contact Lester at: <a href="mailto:lester.cox@icloud.com"><strong>lester.cox@icloud.com</strong></a>
Your talents can make a lasting difference. Join us in strengthening Scouting for generations to come.
