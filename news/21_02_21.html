<p>Wow I did not expect to earn a winter camping patch in my own house. Those scout skills came in really handy when the power failed. I hope everyone is mostly back to normal and not too many frozen pipes. We are still dealing with COVID, but after almost a year we have figured out how to manage this challenge. With declining cases and vaccine roll out things are looking better, however two messages; Don't wait get your scouts camping and advancing. Continue to follow the COVID protocols to keep everyone safe.</p>

Those who complete this course will receive a certification thru NTBHA. The minimal course of $15.00 includes lunch.

<p>Course will be held at Camp James Ray. Registration on Black pug now available: <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021WFA">https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021WFA</a><br />
The Wilderness First Aid (WFA) Training is a 16-hour, hands-on course to give adult leaders the experience needed to handle illness and injury when medical care is more than an hour away. When paired with CPR/AED certifications, leaders are well prepared to deal with emergencies and routine medical issues that may occur on an outdoor adventure.</p>
<p>All four of the BSA high-adventure bases (HAB) require at least one person per trek (two per trek at Philmont Scout Ranch) to be current in WFA. Of course, having more participants trained in WFA skills is highly recommended for any high adventure or backcountry experience.

<p>The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO. The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT?fbclid=IwAR26pr2ekIzf4lG2_UM3gFYfxK0hqur9e91U5qXU2WdWyTUdTpzW3Qj_eSk">More information.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">2021 Friends of Scouting Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Fellow Scouters, I hope this newsletter finds you recovered from any adversity you may have faced due to the recent treacherous weather conditions. In times of challenge, we are reminded of the life-saving benefit of being prepared and, in turn, the concrete importance of the Scouting program.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we need robust Scouting programs to teach the next generation life skills learned on the journey to Eagle. We need FOS funding to keep our programs vibrant and relevant. Once the snow melts and life returns to a more normal rhythm, I am asking you to please give serious consideration to one of the following FOS giving options:
<ul>
<li>Going on-line and making a personal contribution today</li>
<li>Reaching out to your employer for corporate matching funds</li>
<li>Volunteering to help with our fundraising efforts through networking</li>
<li>Inviting one of our FOS speakers to your next Scouting event such as a Blue & Gold or Court of Honor</li>
<li>Establishing a connection between Vaughn Dubose or Trey Otte and one or more of your Unit’s “Key Three” leaders.</li>
</ul>
***If your pack or troop is only holding virtual events, we would love a chance to speak during one of your online meetings this spring. 
Please reach out to Vaughn Dubose, FOS Family Chairperson, at vaughndubose@gmail.com or Trey Otte, 2021 Friends of Scouting Chairperson, at trey@otte.us if you are able to help in any way. Thank you so much.
</p>
