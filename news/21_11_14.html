<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Only 10 units have started the recharter process. This recharter is easier than ever. If your unit uses Scoutbook, it can complete recharter through Scoutbook. If you use another program, you can access recharter through the Internet Advancement portal. Any questions or problems please contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>There are 2 scheduled recharter clinics available, all at FUMC-Richardson all starting at 7:00 pm. The dates are <span style="font-weight:bold;">November 11, November 30, and December 9</span>.</p>
<p>Here are some documents which may help:<br />

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">New Eagle-required MB, Citizenship in Society</strong></p>
<p>Most of you have probably heard about a new Eagle-required merit badge.  It is called Citizenship in Society.  It is available as of Nov 1, 2021 and becomes Eagle-required on July 1, 2022.  Here are the phase-in rules, as recently clarified by National:</p>
<div style="margin-left:15px;">
<p>
"Eagle Scout candidates will continue to use the current rank requirements until June 30, 2022 and will not be required to complete the new Citizenship in Society Merit Badge as long as they complete all of the current Eagle Rank requirements before July 1, 2022. They do not have to submit their  final Eagle Scout application nor complete their Eagle Scout Board of Review prior to July 1, 2022, but must complete all current Eagle Scout requirements before then.</p>

<p>The online videos and FAQ will be updated soon, if not already done.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Membership</strong> </p>
