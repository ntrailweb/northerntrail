<p>BAT is an interactive course designed for those Individuals and Units who are preparing for a high-adventure trek and for those interested in organizing first time backcountry activities for their Unit. The course is titled “Leave the Trailer Behind!” and is directed towards Individuals and Units that want to introduce more backpacking to their annual program. This is a great opportunity as a Unit activity for new or seasoned backpackers or to prepare for future backpacking treks. Two classroom sessions are followed by a weekend backpacking camp-out adventure. The course features information and instruction detailing trek preparation, crew dynamics, and techniques of backpacking - hiking, camping, and preparing meals on the trail. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/back-country-advanced-training">Read more and register.</a></p>

<p>This introduction to Scouts BSA is for Webelos I and II, Cub Leaders, Scouts BAS units and Leaders. It will be held at Camp James Ray on Lake Texoma. about 70) miles North from Richardson)<br />
Webelos Woods is a great time for Webelos 1 & 2 to earn some Adventures toward their Arrow of Light Award.<br />
This year’s event is to be held on November, 8-10, 2019.<br />
It is encouraged that Webelos Dens begin Camping with a scout Troop of their choice, as a means to determine which Troop To Cross-Over. This year’s format is different, and will allow Den Leaders to sign-up their Dens for the Adventures of their choice. It is recommended that Dens schedule in advance, or at check-in on Friday night. Each Den is encouraged to have a scout from their Host Troop to serve as a guide, and help the Den negotiate the day’s events. This Den Guide should be present at the time of scheduling. Ms. Vickie Fierova will be available to help recruit Den Guides and help in scheduling, as will Ms. Curly Top Welch. And Ms Barbra Richter will help with Registration. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/webelos-woods-1182019-11102019">More information.</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong> Deadlines approaching!</p>
<p><i>Silver Beaver Deadline:</i> <b>November 22, 2019</b></p>
<p>Scouting is possible only because of the tireless work of countless volunteers. You will find these volunteers in your unit, organizing events, helping with activities and working directly with the youth. They are the parents, committee members, Den Leaders, Scout Leaders and Venturing Advisers. Beyond the unit at the district level are volunteers who mentor unit leaders as unit commissioners. District volunteers also work to offer training and district activities. Other volunteers work to help start new units and recruit new scouts. Then there are those who work on the critical task of raising the need funds for council operations. At the council level, volunteers serve in many of the same capacities but at a larger scale.</p>
<p>It is fitting that we recognize these volunteers at all levels and a mechanism is in place to do just that. At the unit level we have the Y.E.S. award which recognizes volunteers in individual units. At the district level we have the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Finally at the council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Nominations come from the scouting community and that means you. Please take a minute and review the awards and consider someone you know who should be recognized. More information and nomination forms may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">here</a>.
