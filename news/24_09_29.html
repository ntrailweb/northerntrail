	<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Staying Healthy on Campouts</strong></p>

<p>Looking back in history the pioneers who traversed the Oregon Trail faced many hazards. The greatest hazard was disease often facilitated by contaminated water and poor sanitation. We can learn from this and prioritize basic steps to ensure safe outdoor activities. Obviously protecting and using good water sources is essential. Properly washing dishes and cooking equipment is another and finally reminding scouts and adults that basic hand washing goes a long way towards limiting the spread of disease.</p>
<p>If a scout or an adult is sick, they should not attend a campout. As we get into flu season it’s important to keep this in mind. While COVID is much less of a serious threat as it was in the past, we should still take steps to prevent the spread. Free updated home COVID test kits are now available <a href="https://covidtests.gov"><strong>https://covidtests.gov</strong></a>.</p> 
</p>
<p>Have a great fall camping season.</p>

<p><strong><i>(Date change)</i></strong> Now Thursday, October 10, 2024, 7:00PM at First United Methodist Church, Richardson.</p>

	<p><strong>Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation</strong> (BALOO) is an overnight training event that introduces parents and leaders to the skills needed to plan and conduct Pack outdoor activities, particularly Pack camping. The training includes campsite selection, outdoor event planning, parent involvement, health & safety, equipment, cooking, and an introduction to camping skills.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills</strong> (IOLS) provides adult leaders the practical outdoor skills they need to lead Scouts in the out-of-doors. Participants will work as Patrols at this hands-on training. Upon completion, leaders should feel comfortable teaching Scouts the basic skills required to obtain the First Class rank. All Troops are required to have IOLS trained leaders and all SM/ASMs are required to have it to be fully trained.</p>
