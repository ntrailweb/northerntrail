<p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that Scouting is much more than camping and having fun. The aims of scouting are character development, leadership development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Implementing these aims requires dedicated adults from parents who backup leaders with support, the committee members working behind the scenes and the front line den leaders, merit badge counselors, cub masters, scoutmasters and crew advisers. In addition to unit volunteers we have commissioners and district volunteers who work tirelessly to create and support the programs needed for success.</p>
<p>Everyone has a role and we should thank these volunteers often by acknowledging their contributions. Each year we go a step further and publicly recognize leaders who make that special effort to make scouting work. The impact of their efforts will be felt far into the future. Please take the time to nominate someone you know for recognition. Yes, it's just a piece of paper or a plaque, but it's more than that, it a tangible token of appreciation. At the Unit level we have the <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/yes/">Your Extraordinary Service Award.</a> For district volunteers we have the <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/district-award-merit.html">District Award of Merit</a> and the <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/robert-e-little-service-award.html">Robert E. Little Service Award.</a>. Questions to Dr. Harry Yankuner <a href="mailto:hy18@sbcglobal.net">hy18@sbcglobal.net</a></p>

<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA troops, Venturing Crews and Sea Scout Ships. It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.
Units camp jamboree style with multiple units in a single campsite. The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards. Food is prepared by each unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ).</p>
<p>Each morning, Scouts can work on merit badges, take part in special living history programs in the Mountain Man, Indian Village and Lumberjack areas or learn new program skills. Afternoons offer a wide-range of activities including competitive games, shooting sports, climbing, activities in the living history areas, horseback riding, wood-turning and more! Evenings include special events like a Native American Pow Wow, Cowboy Action Shoot competition, Star Watch parties or just relaxing in the campsite around the campfire. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-WinterCamp2020">https://scoutingevent.com/571-WinterCamp2020</a></p>
