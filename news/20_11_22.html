<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA troops, Venturing Crews and Sea Scout Ships. It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.
Units camp jamboree style with multiple units in a single campsite. The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards. Food is prepared by each unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ).</p>
<p>Each morning, Scouts can work on merit badges, take part in special living history programs in the Mountain Man, Indian Village and Lumberjack areas or learn new program skills. Afternoons offer a wide-range of activities including competitive games, shooting sports, climbing, activities in the living history areas, horseback riding, wood-turning and more! Evenings include special events like a Native American Pow Wow, Cowboy Action Shoot competition, Star Watch parties or just relaxing in the campsite around the campfire.</p>

<p>Scouting only exists due the tireless work of volunteers and the unit, district, council and national level. We are indebted to these individuals who are critical to the success of the scouting movement.</p>
<p>Please take the time to nominate hard working scouters for recognition. A formal recognition is a tangible way to demonstrate to these individuals that their efforts are truly appreciated. Being appreciated is an energizing process and we need energized volunteers to energize scouting.</p>
<p>District and unit award nominations must be completed by <strong>December 12th</strong>. These are <strong>hard</strong> deadlines. More information may be found <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html#overlay-context=">here.</a>.

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection Training is Required</strong></p>
<p>No excuses, get it done today. You can't be a part of the program without a current card. Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a></p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter Deadlines Fast Approaching</strong></p>
<p>Every unit should be working on their re-charters. If you are a member, make sure you have a current YPT card and have submitted any fees and or paperwork to your district chair. We continue to see units which have not started the process. Rather than running down information and nagging, our leaders would rather work on delivering the program. Please don't wait until last minute to get started. Please help avoid the pain, get started today.</p>
<p>December 2nd-Re-charter turn-in in District (2191 West Buckingham) 6:30-8:00pm.</p>
<p>Don't panic, if you need help, contact your <a style="font-weight:bold;" style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> or Hank Voegtle <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a> </p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership is a Year Round Activity</strong></p>
<p><img style="width:50%;float:right;" align="right" hspace="5" src="https://ntrail.org/images/join_cub_scouts.jpg">Scouting only works with a continuous progression, scouts join they advance, move on and new scouts join. Without new members, new potential scouts won't benefit from the program. Allowing your unit to dwindle and die, is not fair to those who came before you who worked so hard to create the program you have enjoyed. Take the time to recruit and keep your unit strong and healthy ready to serve the next generation of scouts.</p>
<p>Our Northern Trail membership committee is working hard to help you achieve these goals. Please participate in these efforts.</p></p>

<p>Every Scouting family should have a <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">yard sign</a>, either Cub Specific or generic. Yard signs will demonstrate that Scouting is thriving in Northern Trail.</p>
