<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Physically Fit</strong></p>
<p>Every time our scouts recite the scout oath, one of the tenets is "Physically Fit." What does this really mean? A common definition is; <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">"A set of attributes that people have or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity."</span> Participation in outdoor activities, hiking and sports are a path to fitness. A healthy diet, getting enough sleep and shedding excess pounds are major factors. As adults, more than anything else, we lead by our example. Scouts notice what we do, more than what we say. It's no secret that most of us carry too much weight and have less than healthy eating habits. There are things you can do. Our troop for example, did not allow any carbonated or sugary beverages on camp-outs. In the beginning we got a lot of grumbling from the scouts, but after a while they got the message. We always had lots of water to drink! In addition, we did our best to have camp-outs which required the scouts to bring their backpacks and carry their gear to a campsite a good distance from the cars. This had two benefits, they got some good exercise and they learned to bring less stuff!</p>
<p>There are no easy answers, but helping our scouts get and stay fit early in life will make it easier for them to develop lifelong good habits of regular exercise and a good diet.</p>
<p>So instead of just having your scouts simply recite this tenet of the scout oath, give your scouts the tools to achieve fitness through your example and guidance.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Upcoming Roundtable</strong> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Date & Time:</span>  Thursday, November 10th @ 7:00 PM<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Place:</span> First United Methodist Church Richardson<br />(503 N Central Expy 1000, Richardson, TX 75080)<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Who:</span>  All unit leaders and parents.</p>
<p>Roundtables are coordinated by the commissioner staff.  They will be discussing and providing assistance with the upcoming re-charter. You will also have an opportunity to meet the unit commissioner assigned to your unit.</p>
<p>Unit commissioners are old hands at scouting and have years of experience with scouting. They can answer questions, provide ideas and encouragement. They have faced many of the same challenges you have many time and have valuable insights.</p>
<p>Roundtables provide an opportunity to meet other unit  leaders and learn what they have been doing in their units.  It's a great way to share information with like minded people all working towards the same goal of creating a great scouting experience for the youth in our community.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">It is Time to Recognize Adult Scouters</strong></p>
<p>It is this time of year when we recognize our fellow scouters for the exemplary volunteer work that they do at the unit, district, and council levels.  We remain thankful to them for their tireless service.</p>
<p>We have several awards to recognize these individuals beginning at the unit level with the Your Extraordinary Service Award or the Y.E.S. Award. At the district level we have two awards: the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Applications for these awards must be submitted no later than Friday, December 9th. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>At the Council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Applications for the Silver Beaver Award must be received no later than Monday, November 21th. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>Self-nominations will not be accepted.</p>
<p>More information, including the submission details of these awards, is available <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;">here</span>.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">District Awards Banquet</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Service Opportunity</p>
<p>Greetings Scouters.  Do you have Scouts or a unit that needs Service hours or a project ..or just wants to 'do a good turn' and be 'helpful'?</p>
<p>The Arlington Charities organization (<a href="https://www.arlingtoncharities.org/"><span style="font-weight:bold;">link</span></a>), a non-profit charitable organization that fights 'hunger, poverty and homelessness' has asked for help from Scouts.  The Program Director is Casey McCollum, a legacy Eagle Scout from North Trail District.  He has started a program asking for donations of usable sleeping bags to be distributed to those folks on the streets with no shelter and in real danger in the coming cold months.</p>
<p>If you and your Scouts are willing to help, please check your unit storage rooms, the trailer and even theirs and your own Scout storage closet for older, no longer used, or extra sleeping bags that could be a life saver for someone in need.</p>
<p>If you find such sleeping bags, please contact John McCollum at 214.497.5276 or <a href="mailto:jmccollum0@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">jmccollum0@gmail.com</span></a> and I will arrange for collection and transport to the Arlington shelter.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone.  Help is available, just ask!</p>
