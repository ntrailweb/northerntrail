<a style="font-size:1.2em;" href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content/why-get-trained">Why Get Trained?</a><br /><br />

"Every boy deserves a trained leader."  We've all heard it, but what does it really mean?  When Baden Powell said those words, he knew that leader training was the key to successful Boy Scout units.  For over 100 years, every study has shown that stronger, successful units are full of trained adults.
<br /><br />
So why not get trained?  The biggest objection to training is the time commitment.  However, trained leaders will tell you their training has saved them many more hours than it took in the first place.  The basics of understanding the program is the place to start.  Then, specific activity ideas are much more forthcoming form the friends you make and the continuing training you attend.
<br /><br />
We all know the mission of Scouting, "To prepare young people to make ethical and moral decisions over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law."  The program is worth it, if all young people were involved in Scouting the world would be a better place; the results speak for themselves (have you chatted with an Eagle Scout lately?); so get trained and make the premier leadership and values based organization in the country the best it can be for your child.

<h3>Cubmobile Race Flagpole Hill</h3>

<table class="main" width=700> 

<tr><td>

There is still time to build a car for the <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:1.1em;">Big Race.</span><br /><br />

Here is an opportunity for your Pack to earn the "Summer Time Pack Activity" award.<br /><br />


This event is sure to be fun for the entire family and bring some excitement to our summer Cub Scout program. Each Cub is encouraged to build their own car, or a den, patrol, or pack can work together to make a team car. Each team should keep their car-to-Cub ratio 1:5. The cars will race using gravity to propel them down the hill and across the finish line. Each car must comply with the safety rules that are outlined here before it will be allowed to race. There are design suggestions in the Bear rank book. You can also Google "cub mobile" for many other design ideas. Each Cub must wear protective gear -- a bicycle safety helmet, football helmet, or racing helmet; long pants; and no open toed shoes. Each Cub must be able to demonstrate how to steer and brake their car. Cubs will queue to race their cars in this fun and casual competition.  <a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content/district-cubmobile-derby-0">More information.</a>
