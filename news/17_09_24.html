<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Procrastination</strong></p>
<p>All of us are guilty of procrastination. It is important to consider that it's not simply about putting things off, it's about a failure to plan. We all intend to do the needed tasks, but we put off making a decision or commitment until later. Unfortunately it has consequences for others. Scouting events are planned months in advance, venues have to be secured, staff recruited, trained and finally people must commit to participate. We are seeing more and more that people delay making a decision until the last minute. This is very disruptive to the planning process because the planners can't gauge the interest and the level of participation. Hosting an event and having very few participants is a poor use of volunteer time. Not having enough supplies because more people than expected show up at the last minute can put a damper on the activity.</p>
<p>We have a number of activities coming up very soon and the rate of signups are lagging. This makes it very difficult to plan and execute successful events. Please take the time to sign up for the upcoming training and activities.</p>

<p>Cub Scout Roundtable would like to thank Barbara Richer for her many years of service and dedication. Barbara had served as staff for more commissioners than she cares to count! Her servant leadership has been valued by many throughout the district. Barbara continues her other scouting responsibilities as she steps down from staffing Roundtable. Thank you Barbara!<br />
