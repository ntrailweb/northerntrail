<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>The Adventure of Summer Camp is Coming</strong></p>
<p>Summer camp will be here soon! For me summer camp is vivid in my memory. When it was over all we wanted to do was stay another week! Great adventures.</p>
<p>Scouting is all about the outdoors. With all the changes these days, it’s amazing to consider that summer camp experiences today are much like they were in the past. Swimming, canoeing, archery, rifle range, hiking, merit badges and more. Just like in the past scouts are housed in tents, eat chow in the mess hall and participate in campfires with silly skits and songs.</p>
<p>For many scouts this will be the first time they have been away from immediate family members, and this is part of growing up. Sometimes scouts can get a little homesick, but building enthusiasm well before camp starts and looking forward to a week with their peers will go a long way towards alleviating any homesickness.</p>
<p>Start planning now and talk up summer camp in your unit. Scouts who don’t attend camp will be challenged to complete some rank requirements and will miss out on an important aspect of scouting. That first camp experience will never be forgotten, and scouts will clamor to go again next year.
