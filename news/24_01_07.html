<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Scouting For Food</strong></p>
<p>February is "Do a good turn month".</p>
<p>Northern Trail District invites your unit to be part of the most visible activity of BSA, Scouting for Food.</p>
<p>Food insecurity continues to be a prevalent issue in our community, especially for children.  20% of children under the age of 18 are food insecure in Dallas County.  "Food insecurity is defined by the USDA as the lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active, healthy life. Key drivers of food insecurity include unemployment, poverty, and income shocks, which can prevent adequate access to food." We can support The Network of Community Ministries in their mission to help the hungry in our area.   One of the aims of Scouting is Character.  Showing care for your fellow neighbor is a great way to display your Citizenship in the Community. Collecting food can help reduce food insecurity and give your scout a sense of helping to make someone’s life better.</p>
<p>This year, we are asking units to conduct a neighborhood food drive.  Donations to be collected and delivered to the Network of Community Ministries on Saturday, February10 between the hours of 9a-2p.</p>
<p>Their address is 1500 International Parkway , Suite 300<br />
Richardson, TX</p>
<p>Sign up is on Black Pug <a href="https://www.scoutingevent.com/571-2024NTSFF"><strong>scoutingevent.com/571-2024NTSFF</strong></a> 
for more information contact Scouting for Food Chair: Dory Petsrillo, <a href="mailto:dlmp616@gmail.com"><strong>dlmp616@gmail.com</strong></a> or DE Katherine McCrary, <a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org"><strong>Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</strong></a>
