<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>I came across this quote the other day and it struck a chord with me.  “Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day.”   Most of us won’t find a cure for cancer or even save a life, but every day we have the opportunity to make a difference.  Keep in mind that both the scout oath and law address the need to be helpful.</p>
<p>In scouting there are a million small opportunities to help and they do surround us every day.  
For example, be supportive of the volunteer leaders in your units.  By supportive this means being responsive to pleas for action.   Actions might be as simple as obtaining your youth protection card, paying your dues and making sure your scout has what is need to participate in an activity.   
Often people assume that leaders have special skills not held by the rest of us in general.  This is profoundly not true.  Often times they must and do call upon others to help because they lack the skills or the time.  Can you give your time to filling out a place on the committee?  Sure one or two people might attempt to perform all the tasks, but a broader talent base will not only get the tasks done, but they will be done more efficiently and with less effort by those who possess the special skills.  Someone who is good a record keeping and computer skills might be the best person for tasks performed by the treasurer and advancement chair.</p>
<p>There are numerous small ways that each of us can make a difference in and out of scouting.  As adults we possess life skills which our scouts are just starting to accumulate.  The more adults available to interact with scouts, the greater the opportunity to kindle a spark of understanding or ignite an interest which will change the life for the better for yours or someone else’s scout.  
On more than one occasion I was able to reassure and encourage a scout leader who was ready to quit by gently reminding them that it was about the youth.  A small thing, but the result was much larger because those individuals continued to contribute.</p>  
<p>So next time someone in your unit reaches out for help, remember to seize the opportunities that surround us every day.</p>
