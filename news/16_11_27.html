<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Unit Re-Charter</strong></p>

<p>Don't put this off, if your charter drops it's very hard on everyone to put the pieces back together.  Do it on time and it's much simpler.   If you not started, start today.  Help is available, your unit commissioner can assist with the process.  If you are not directly responsible for the re-charter process you can help.  Every adult must have a current youth protection training card.   Everyone needs to pay their membership fees.  Do it today!   <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/re-charter-checklist">Re-charter Checklist</a></strong></p>

<p>“To keep myself physically strong” is the oath we take, and the role model we display to our boys.  It is also a necessity for our outdoor activities such as camping, hiking and high adventures.  As “Resolution Day” approaches, we begin to set goals for ourselves for next year.  Often times, these goals include getting our self into better physical condition.  Join us in December for our Roundtable discussion on being prepared for outdoor activities.  Please bring your stories of how you and your troop get ready for hikes, canoe trips and other activities.  One thing we can share with each other is our favorite places to do warm-up hikes and shakedowns. </p>
