<p>Twilight Camp 2020: Restructured</p>
<p>For 2020 Circle Ten Council has restructured Day and Twilight Camps council-wide because of coronavirus/COVID19. Because of that, Northern Trail District will not be holding our traditional Twilight Camp at Breckinridge Park.</p>
<p>Instead, there will be a council-wide an at home Day Camp program that begins on May 15. There will be activities posted on that date that Cubs and their families can do at home. These activities will be divided into four parts: for all Cubs (grades 1-5), younger Cubs (grades 1-3), older Cubs (grades 4-5), and rank specific activities. While the program starts on May 15, registration for the home program will open on June 1. For a fee of $5.00, each Cub registered will get this year’s “Down on the Farm” camp patch. The patches will be mailed every Monday.</p>
<p>There is a second part of this year’s Cub Day Camp, an at Camp experience. These one-day sessions will be held at Camp Wisdom on June 16, June 18, June 20, June 23, June 25, June 27, August 8, and August 29. There will also be two sessions at Camp James Ray in Pottsboro, Texas, on August 1 and August 22. In keeping with the times, there will be limited enrollment for these camps. Registration for the at Camp experience will also open on June 1. The cost for youth will be $20 and for adults attending $10. Each youth must be accompanied by an adult to participate.</p>
<p>The at Camp experience provide what we have offered at Breckinridge Park: BB guns, archery, crafts and games, plus SWIMMING! Lunch is included and will be catered at the June sessions.<br /><span style="font-size:1.2em; color:red; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">A youth must register for the at home experience to be able to attend the at Camp experience.</span></p>
<p>Because of this change in plans, volunteers are needed to staff these activity areas: games, crafts, and cleaning crews. If you have the appropriate certifications, there might be openings for you in the archery or BB guns areas. There will be two cleaning crews, one on the days of camp to clean and disinfect between classes and the other on the day after camp to give everything a deep cleaning. If you can help on one or more days, and we really do need the help, please contact Hank Voegtle at 214-769-5040.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">At-Home Day Camp - update</p>
<p>May 15th the Circle Ten Council will be releasing it’s at-Home day camp material free to all families. This program will be simple and fun for all members of the family to do together! Then on June 1st, register your Scout's participation, via the Black Pug system, in the at-Home camp (don’t worry if you haven’t completed the home portion yet!). This is also your family’s opportunity to sign up for one, or more, of Circle Ten Council’s at-Camp one-day experiences. These at-Camp experiences will be a fun filled one-day camp experience where Scouts and siblings can participate at $20 each. At least one parent is required to attend with their Scout(s) at $10 each. Activities will be games, crafts, BB gun shooting, archery, swimming, and more. While all 6 dates in June take place at Camp Wisdom; 2 of the 4 dates will take place at Camp James Ray with the other 2 at Camp Wisdom for a total of 10 dates in the months of June and August! Stay tuned for more information on our at-Home day camp and how your family could win prizes for Scouting-at-Home and posting to Facebook.</p>

<p>All BSA High Adventures bases plan to operate in some way this summer. All have made changes and as each one says there will be more changes needed as new information/data becomes available. Each base on their website will have update on the 1st and 15th of each month. In general, they would like to work only with only the lead advisor/continent leader via email/telephone to cut down on the number of people with whom they are communicating. Northern Tier did give out a special contact number for 972-350-3502 On the Northern Tier website there is a hot link to a video from Al Lambert, National director of Outdoor Adventure and the National High Adventure Base General Managers. <a href="https://zoom.us/rec/play/v8F4JuyvqDs3S4GT4gSDBvd4W9S-fKis1ilKrqcJyE6yUSULYVShYrcSZLQdAvqI-jBi2Ow4iuoQ6tWG?startTime=1588347441000&_x_zm_rtaid=m-7kTcF6SIqzbnL2YR5_jg.1588536866797.7624a82b6ad6b7d1b0e6a0150fef324f&_x_zm_rhtaid=580">Link to video.</a></p>

<p>WFA/CPR/AED certification<br />
Philmont, Northern Tier, Summit - would like for the crew to have the current required certificates but will not deny any crew from having a high adventure experience this summer. Currently they say there is no on-line class that meets the requirements.</p>
<p>Sea Base - from their website:<br />
"Wilderness First Aid Expired Certifications Sea Base will accept WFA certifications that have been “extended” by the training agency. The individual must meet all requirements of the extension. CPR Several approved CPR training agencies have begun offering online courses including American Red Cross (ARC)."</p>
<p>To my knowledge the on-line CPR/AED courses require hands-on demonstration of CPR/AED with a certified instructor.</p>
<p>With the present distancing and number of people allowed together at one location rules, it is not possible to offer a WFA or CPR/AED class.</p>
<p>Be flexible and hopefully everyone can have a high adventure experience this summer.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Merit Badges From Home</strong></p>
<p>At Least 58 merit badges that Scouts can complete from home. The merit badges on the list meet two main criteria:
<ul>
<li>They don’t involve visits to public places or companies.</li>
<li>Their requirements can be completed indoors or in an average-size yard.</li>
</ul>Here is the link to the article on Bryan for Scouting.
<a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/03/20/merit-badges-for-social-distancing/">https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/03/20/merit-badges-for-social-distancing/</a>.
</p>
<p>During this challenging time, we sometimes find it difficult for Scouts to meet certain requirements. We can be tempted to apply "common sense" in interpreting those requirements But one fundamental of the merit badge program is that requirements must be met as written and no one, or no authority, can change those requirements, unless they are officially changed at BSA.</p>
<p>Several merit badges have requirements that a Scout "attend" a meeting or some other function. Our Council Advancement Chair has recently weighed in on this one. The dictionary meaning of "attend" is "be present at". That means the Scout needs to be present in person. Given that many meetings these days are on-line, if a Scout is present via Zoom, or some similar tool, as the meeting or function is happening, then that does meet the definition of "attend". However, watching a recording or time-delayed video stream does not meet the definition.</p>
<p>This means that certain merit badge requirements, including some Eagle required merit badges such as Citizenship in the Community, cannot be completed until the Scout can attend in person, or the meeting is conducted and available on some real-time, on-line platform. There are plenty of other merit badges that can be earned,and most requirements can be met while still maintaining the mandated social distancing.</p>
<a id="ar"></a>
<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Advancement Resources</strong></p>

<p>With the CONVID-19 situation, scouting has adapted. Boards of review, even Eagle Boards may be held electronically. <a href=
"https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/default/files/media/district/nt/Electronic_Boards_of_Review.pdf">Here</a> is a pdf document which describes the process.</p>

<p>Merit Badges may be in many cases worked on while scouts are stuck at home. <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-065.pdf">Here is a guide for Merit Badge counseling.</a></p>

<p>In all cases be sure and comply with the safe environment procedures outlined in Youth Protection Training.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Internet Advancement Access for Councils and Units</strong></p>
<p>The new Internet Advancement web platform is specially designed for both council employees and unit leaders to track and record unit advancements. The platform was built to optimize unit management and includes features that enable council employees or leaders to record the same advancement for many youth at once.</p>
<p>Since many of us are stuck at home, this is a great time to get up to speed on this new tool.</p>

Council Annual Recognition Banquet</strong></a> Date Change, AGAIN!</p>
<p>Please be aware that the event is now set for <span style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday, August 8th</span>. The council banquet is still on!</p>
<p>We learned this week that the Plano Event Center will remain closed for the whole month of June. We have moved the council banquet again to Saturday, August 8th. It will be at the same time at the same location. We are hoping that our new date in early August will allow our graduating seniors to attend before they leave for college.
We have implemented many changes for this year to further ensure the health of all who attend our event. The Plano Event Center has formulated plans that will follow strict guidelines and be approved by those regulating health standards for their industry. We have a long relationship with the Plano Event Center and feel confident with them and moving forward with our event. We are optimistic that Texans will continue to follow state safety guidelines and keep COVID 19 in check.</p>
<p>All who are currently registered for the event will remain registered. If you are no longer available for our event, you may cancel your reservation by emailing Michael Prachar at <a href="mailto:Michael.prachar@scouting.org">Michael.prachar@scouting.org</a> by June 20th to receive a full refund. You may also contact me to substitute the name of one of your paid guests. Please notify Leigh Anne LeBlanc, the council banquet chair, at <a href="mailto:leighcat3@gmail.com">leighcat3@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will keep you posted on the status of the event. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and your guests. As Scouters, we must do our part to protect the community and our families.</p>

Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
