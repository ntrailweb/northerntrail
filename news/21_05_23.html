<h2>Sunday May 23, 2021</h2>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Friendly	</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>From the Scout Handbook -  "Be a friend to everyone, even people who are very different from you."  We are naturally very tribal and must make an effort to be welcoming to others we encounter. A scout is a friend to all and makes an effort to make new members of his unit welcome.  Leaders, remind your scouts to be friendly.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Summer Camp</strong></p>
<p><img align="left" hspace="5" style="max-width:30%; float:left; margin:5px;" src="https://ntrail.org/images/tent.avif"></p>Summer camp is the experience of a lifetime. Young people only have a few years to experience summer camp and the memories and skills will last a lifetime. I don't remember a lot about those years, however, decades later I remember summer camp clearly.

<p>Circle Ten has programs this summer to fit your schedule and interests. Camps are filling fast, so claim your spot.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/80636/maverick-camp">Maverick</a> program has been expanded, so if you cannot go with your troop, you can still attend camp.
