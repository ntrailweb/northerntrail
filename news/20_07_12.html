<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Training</p>
<p>We know that many of you have been putting this off, but now is the time to act and get the required training. Lack of a current youth protection card is a showstopper, and this need not be the case. Allocate some time in front of your computer and "get er done."</p> 

<p>To take the course visit <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org</a>. Many Northern Trail unit Scoutmasters, Cubmasters and Den leaders are not position trained. Training is required for these positions and will make your job as a leader easier. In addition, be sure and take advantage of the wealth of other training resources. Hazardous Weather Training, Safety afloat. Merit Badge counselor and troop committee training. <a href="https://my.scouting.org/Documents/PositionTrainedCourses.pdf">Here</a> is a chart which explains the training requirements for each scouting position. </p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
