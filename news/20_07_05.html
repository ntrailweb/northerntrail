<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Email System Change</p>
<p>Our attempt to move our email newsletter to the IHUB has failed. The district is switching to another service to replace the one we have been using.</p>
<p>You should have received an email a few minutes before this one confirming that you have been moved to the new system. If you received that email, no further action is required. If you did not, please signup <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/email_signup_form.html">here.</a> Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding.</p>

<strong>Scouting Works. Scouting Matters. Scouting Lasts … A Lifetime.</strong></p>
<p>The Friends of Scouting Campaign is winding down. Due to the pandemic and the missed opportunity to reach out at Courts of Honor and Blue and Gold Banquets we failed to reach our goal.</p>

<p>If you made a pledge thank you! We know these are difficult times and we appreciate the sacrifice.</p>

<p>There is still time to make a pledge if you are able, even a small amount makes a difference. <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/54885/we-need-your-help">Scouting</a> is more important than ever and your help will make it possible to get us through these challenging times.</p>

<p>We've made it easier than ever to <a href="https://donations.scouting.org/#/council/571/appeal/15">donate</a> (Phone friendly <a href="https://ntrail.org/fos/">donation</a> page.)</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">COVID-19</p>
<p>There has been a bit of a setback and the governor has tightened the protocols a little. Units can still meet, but clubs, such as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, TOP Teens, (of TOP Ladies of Distinction), FFA, and Girls, Inc., may hold meetings. Meetings held indoors should not exceed 50% of the venue's occupancy limit.</p><p>The governor has released new guidance as of 7/3/2020 detailing the procedures. They may be found <a href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/coronavirus/docs/opentx/june/YouthClubs.pdf">here.</a> During these meetings, encourage social distancing and avoid being in a group larger than 10 individuals..

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Training Awards</p>
<p>It takes effort to get the proper training. However, training makes all the difference. Trained leaders are more effective, less stressed and the scouts have a better experience.</p>
<p>Committee members, please take the time to recognize these efforts by applying for training awards. An application for the "Scouter’s Training Award for Cub Scouting" may be found <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/training/pdf/511-057_WB.pdf">here.</a></p><p>The application for "Scouter's Training Award for Scouts BSA Leaders" may be found <a href="https://i9peu1ikn3a16vg4e45rqi17-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Scouters-Training-Award-for-Scout-BSA-Leaders.pdf">here.</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Training</p>
<p><strong>Caution,</strong> for about half of Northern Trail scouters, their Youth Protection Certificates is two years old and has or will expire soon. Now is the time to take care of this requirement. Every adult in the program must have a current certificate.</p>
<p>To take the course visit <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org</a>. Many Northern Trail unit Scoutmasters, Cubmasters and Den leaders are not position trained. Training is required for these positions and will make your job as a leader easier. In addition, be sure and take advantage of the wealth of other training resources. Hazardous Weather Training, Safety afloat. Merit Badge counselor and troop committee training. <a href="https://my.scouting.org/Documents/PositionTrainedCourses.pdf">Here</a> is a chart which explains the training requirements for each scouting position. </p>

Council Annual Recognition Banquet</a></p>
<p>Please be aware that the event is now set for <span style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday, August 8th</span>. The council banquet is still on!</p>
<p>We have implemented many changes for this year to further ensure the health of all who attend our event. The Plano Event Center has formulated plans that will follow strict guidelines and be approved by those regulating health standards for their industry. We have a long relationship with the Plano Event Center and feel confident with them and moving forward with our event. We are optimistic that Texans will continue to follow state safety guidelines and keep COVID-19 in check.</p>
<p>All who are currently registered for the event will remain registered. If you are no longer available for our event, you may cancel your reservation by emailing Michael Prachar at <a href="mailto:Michael.prachar@scouting.org">Michael.prachar@scouting.org</a> by July 20th to receive a full refund.

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
