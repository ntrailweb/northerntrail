<p>Time is running out, Camp is only a few short weeks away. Paperwork needs to be turned in and processed by our volunteer staff. Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone and makes in more difficult for the staff to focus on the fun! So if you have not signed up for Twilight Camp do it today.</p>
<p>Walking den leaders, adult camp staff and junior staff members are needed and everyone must complete the needed paperwork. Training, including Face to Face Youth Protection for walking den leaders, will be held in May. The remaining date is May 25 from 7pm to 9 pm in Room 205 at First United Methodist Church in Richardson (503 N. Central Expressway, Richardson, TX 75080). All questions will be answered! Please bring your completed Medical forms A &amp; B to the training. You may also mail your completed forms to: <a href="mailto:registrar@ntrail.org">registrar@ntrail.org</a></p>
