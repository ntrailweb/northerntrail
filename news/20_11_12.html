<h2>Special Announcements: Thursday November 12, 2020</h2>

<h2>Roundtable, Tonight!</h2>

<h2>Adult Award Deadlines; November 19th & December 12th</h2>

<p>Dear Scouter,</p>

<p>I am writing to tell you about important tasks which need to be completed very soon. </p>
<p>Scouting would be impossible without the dedicated service of countless volunteers at all levels in the organization. You may not realize it, but the number of professional staff members is tiny compared to the army of volunteers who tirelessly give of their time talent and yes, financial resources to make scouting successful.</p>

<p>We may not like to admit it, but being told that their contributions are valued helps these volunteers maintain their focus and energy. You can help fuel their enthusiasm by responding to their calls for assistance with events at the unit, district and council level.</p>

<p>Every year we have the opportunity to go a step further and demonstrate our appreciation in a more lasting fashion with a tangible token in the form of a formal award.</p>

<p>There are a number of awards which can be given to adult scouters at the unit, district and council level.</p>

<p>Your Extraordinary Service Award</p>

<p>The Y.E.S. award recognizes individuals in units who have provided extraordinary service to their units. Every Unit receives 2 nominations, units that have 50-99 youth members are entitled to an additional nomination, and Units with 100 or more youth members are allowed a total of 4 nominations. Deadline for submissions is December 12th. More information and how to nominate someone in your unit may be found <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/yes/">here</a>.<p>

<h2>The District Award of Merit</h2>

<p>This award is a council award presented by districts or Venturing divisions in the same manner that the Silver Beaver is a national award presented by councils. Deadline for submissions is December 12th. More information may be found <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/district-award-merit.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Robert E. Little Award</h2>

<p>The Northern Trail District committee presents the Robert E. Little Service Award to a scouter who has rendered outstanding service to the scouting movement at the unit and/or district level. It is given primarily for dedicated service, personal effort, and unselfish interest contributed beyond the immediate responsibilities of the position or positions held over a period of years. More information and nomination form may be found <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/robert-e-little-service-award.html">here</a>. Deadline for submissions is December 12th.</p>

<h2>The Silver Beaver Award</h2>

<p>Silver Beaver Nominations are due <span style="font-weight:bold;">November 19th</span>. Nomination form This <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-103_WB.pdf">form</a> may be downloaded filled out and emailed to <a href="mailto:HY18@sbcglobal.net">HY18@sbcglobal.net</a>. We have many scouters in Northern Trail that could be nominated, and you could easily be that person who gets their nomination started. Think about the scouters you have seen at events in the last year and could you nominate one of them. If you have questions about how to get the needed information ask other scouters who might know. Also you can contact me for assistance.</p>
<p>Yours in Scouting,</p>
<p>Dr. Harry Yankuner<br />
