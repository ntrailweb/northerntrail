<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Help your Scouts achieve Eagle rank</strong> </p>

<p>The Eagle rank is different than all other Scouting ranks.  It is the highest, most recognized award in Scouting and has a different process than other ranks which varies from Council to Council and District to District. Come to Round Table this month to learn how our district, Northern Trail, handles that process.</p>  
<p>In a nutshell, Eagle advancement in Northern Trail is a partnership between units and the District.  A District representative, called an Eagle Designee, must approve the Scout's project proposal and sit on the Eagle board of review.  You can find the list of Northern Trail Eagle Designees <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/34484/northern-trail-district-advancement"><strong>here</strong></a>.  Only the scouters on this list can approve Eagle Projects and represent the District at Eagle boards of review in Northern Trail.</p>
<p>Come to Round Table on March 9 to learn more about this process and how to help your Scouts achieve the Eagle rank.</p>  
  
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Roundtable</strong></p>
<p>Roundtable will be held on Thursday, March 9th at 7:00PM at the First United Methodist Church of Richardson, 503 North Central Expressway. This event is for Scout leaders and parents in all programs.  There will be a breakouts for Eagle Application process,  Cub Scouting Summer Program and Activities for Dens/Packs. Catch up on opportunities for your scouts in scouting.</p>
