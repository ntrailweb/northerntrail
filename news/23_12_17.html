<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Scouting is about Delayed Gratification</strong></a></p>
<p>Scouting is designed to be fun, and the "fun" has a purpose.  Scouts don't instantly progress from Cub Scout to Eagle Scout.  It's a progression, and scouts must demonstrate progress towards critical life skills.</p>
<p>It is not an accident that progress becomes more challenging along the way and scouts must spend a minimum amount of time at each stage to progress.</p>
<p>Many of the requirements for rank advancement require time and advance planning. This demonstrates to scouts that success requires persistence and time with rewards coming later. Measured improvement in personal fitness, executing a personal financial plan are examples.</p>  
<p>It's no secret that as parents we often need to nudge and remind our scouts to work towards these goals even when they would rather do something else. As scouts achieve success along the way, the clarity of the need for delayed gratification will become clearer to them.  Every scout parent at one time or another will have a scout who wants to drop out of scouting.</p>
<p>Over the years I have had many adults and parents tell me that they regretted dropping out of scouting or not going further.  I've had scouts who were in my unit who are now adults, thank me for encouraging them to stay in scouting.</p>
<p>If you want your scout to benefit by staying in scouting, don't be afraid to nudge them a bit. However, it is important to demonstrate this by your active participation. Not everyone will be a Scoutmaster or Cubmaster, but every adult can provide support to the unit. There are many jobs to be done and spreading the load makes for a better functioning unit.</p>
<p>I have sat on many Eagle Scout boards of review and with only a few exceptions the parents were well known to the board members. Scouts without the active involvement of their parents were clearly at a disadvantage.</p>   
<p>Remember the importance of delayed gratification, we want our future children to be good citizens, good parents, and good employees.  Invest the time and effort.  Your child's future self will thank you for it.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Scouting for Food</p>
<p>After a COVID pause, Northern Trail will have Scouting for Food.  
Thousands of people in our community are hungry with almost half of these being children.  Through Scouting for Food we have the opportunity to help alleviate this need. February is Good Turn Month and we have set February 10 as the date for our food drive.  
We are asking units to conduct food drives in their neighborhoods to benefit the Network of Community Ministries.

If your unit is interested in helping with this service project, please contact District Scouting for Food Chair, Dory Petsrillo , <a href="mailto:dlmp616@gmail.com"><strong>dlmp616@gmail.com</strong></a> or our District Executive, Katherine McCrary

<p>March 8-10 (most activities on the 9th).  Registered Venturers, Sea Scouts, and Explorer Post members are invited.  We will be inviting people from the entire NST 8 (National Service Territory) this year and are hoping to restore the event to pre-COVID days.  Much planning to be done but we need people to save the date and consider joining a Venturing Crew if they want to participate.</p>
