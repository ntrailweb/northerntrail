	<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>The Promise of Scouting</strong></p>

	<p>This time of year we often hear that some scouts and parents are hesitant to continue with scouting. The reasons are many: time, other commitments like sports and cost.</p>
	<p>Scouting is much more than entertainment. The fun is the hook and once we have the attention of the scout we can then work to deliver the promise of scouting.</p>
	<p>It’s possible to participate in sports, band and scouting all at the same time. It may require a little juggling, but it can be done. The long term benefits of the scout program are too great to ignore.</p>
	<p>I found the following description of the promise of scouting from an old handbook. 

	<p><strong>Scouting</strong> promises you the great outdoors. As a Scout, you can learn to camp and hike without leaving a trace and how to take care of the land. You’ll study wildlife up close and learn about nature all around you. There are plenty of skills for you to master, and you can teach others what you have learned. Everyone helping everyone else—that’s part of Scouting, too.</p>
	<p><strong>Scouting</strong> promises you friendship. Members of the troop you join might already know, and you will meet many other Scouts along the way. Some could become lifelong friends.</p>
	<p><strong>Scouting</strong> promises you opportunities to work toward the Eagle Scout rank. You will set positive goals for yourself and then follow clear routes to achieve them.</p>
	<p><strong>Scouting</strong> promises you tools to help you make the most of your family, your community, and your nation. The good deeds you perform every day will improve the lives of those around you. You will be prepared to help others in time of need.</p>
	<p><strong>Scouting</strong> promises you experiences and duties that will help you mature into a strong, wise adult. The Scout Oath and the Scout Law can guide you while you are a Scout and throughout your life.</p> 

	<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter / Renewal Information</strong></p>
	<p>The process for individual renewals and unit recharter has changed this year. Here are two documents which cover some of the details of the process.</p>

	<p>This document describes the process for individual renewal with several prossible options: <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/Renewal_Guidebook_BM_edits.pdf"><strong>ntrail.org/documents/Renewal_Guidebook_BM_edits.pdf</strong></a></p>

	<p>This document describes the process for unit renewal and there are several options here as well: <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/Unit_Renewal.pdf"><strong>ntrail.org/documents/Unit_Renewal.pdf</strong></a></p>

	<p>If you have questions, please contact your unit commissioner.</p>


	<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024AdvancementAcademy"><strong>Aloha Advancement Academy</strong></a> Saturday August 24, 2024, Wisdom</strong></p>
	<img src="https://ntrail.org/clipart/aloha.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" style="max-width:20%; float:right; margin-left:5px;">
	<p><strong>Aloha Advancement Academy</strong> is focused on Scouts BSA advancement, and covers all advancement topics, “soup to nuts,” likely to impact a troop. <strong>All Troop Leaders</strong>, and parents, too, are welcome to join us for a fun-filled, informative day of relevant training designed to bring the BSA Guide to Advancement to life. Scoutmasters, Committee Chairs, Unit Advancement Chairs, and Eagle Coaches/Advisors are especially recommended to attend. NEW UNITS formed in the last few years who haven’t attended this training before would find the time well spent. Leaders of Crews and Ship who work with SBSA advancement in their unit would also find this class instructional.</p>
	<p>Uniform of the day is a Hawaiian Shirt – prizes to the most memorable! Fun, games, and door prizes will make the day as entertaining as it is instructive. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024AdvancementAcademy"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>


	<img align="right" style="max-width:25%; float:right; margin-left:5px;" src="https://ntrail.org/clipart/powder_horn.jpg">

	<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Powder Horn September 6-8, & 20-22, 2024</strong></p>
	<p>Powder Horn is a Resource Course designed to help you improve your unit’s older Scout outdoor and high adventure program. Powder Horn is an action-packed, hands-on, five-day course. Adult Leaders as well as Scouts ages 14 and older are eligible and encouraged to attend. There are no restrictions on attending the course a second time.</p>
	<p>Powder Horn is designed to introduce and expose troop, crew, and ship adult and youth leaders to activities and resources necessary to manage a successful outdoor or high adventure unit-level program. Originally designed to support the Venturing Ranger award, we have expanded the focus to help troops develop outdoor programs that challenge older (14+) Scouts.</p>
	<p>Powder Horn is a fun introduction to skills but does not train you to be an expert. Powder Horn provides an initial introduction to a variety of different high adventure activities and an introduction to working with consultants in delivering those programs. Units will still need to find knowledgeable, trained, and certified individuals to provide a safe and exciting outdoor high adventure program, but Powder Horn will show you how to do this. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024PowderHorn"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>

	<p>If you or someone you know is interested in this position, please let me or the district chair know. I will be happy to mentor my replacement and provide council after the baton has been passed.</p>
