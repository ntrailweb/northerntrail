<p<img align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/small_BSACircleTenLogo.jpg">Scouting depends on volunteers and contributions to make the program run.   Please take a moment to schedule a time for a presenter to come to your Court of Honor or Blue and Gold Banquet and make a short presentation about Friends of Scouting.  It will only take a about 15 minutes.   It 's essential that our local Circle Ten Council have adequate funds to implement this great program with the necessary camps, professional staff and service centers.  Without these assets the program could not function.  If you have questions contact: Jesus Vazquez  <a href="mailto:Jesus.Vazquez@scouting.org">Jesus.Vazquez@scouting.org</a></p>
