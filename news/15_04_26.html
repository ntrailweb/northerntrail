<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Obedient</strong></p>
<p>A Scout follows the rules of his family, school, and troop. He obeys the laws of his community and country. If he thinks these rules and laws are unfair, he tries to have them changed in an orderly manner rather than disobeying them.
  Scouting reinforces this basic value.</p>
