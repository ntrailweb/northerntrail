	<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>The Art of Compromise</strong></p>

<p>As leaders and parents we sometimes get into disagreements about how the program is run. Sometimes more difficult questions arise as in how to deal with a difficult or disruptive scout.</p>
<p>The good news is that scout training will clarify many of these issues and avoid common disagreements. Training clearly lays down the tried and true procedures for success. Implementing the scout program as it is designed will yield good results.</p>
<p>Don't let minor issues derail the cooperative environment essential for success.</p>
<p>I have always been amazed that even when scouting events run into problems, they always seem to work out in the end. A little imagination and resourcefulness usually wins the day.</p>

	<p>You will be put into patrols just like your scouts and learn the patrol method, recruiting, and many more troop functions. You will be able to ask questions and interact with other leaders.</p>
	<p>From the ALT course you and your patrol of adult leaders will stay together going into IOLS training on October 19th. The IOLS course registration is on Black Pug.</p>
	<p>ALT Cost is $10 – To sign up, please contact Jeff Rauscher – Course Director at <a href="mailto:jeffdrauscher@yahoo.com"><strong>jeffdrauscher@yahoo.com</strong></a>.</p>
