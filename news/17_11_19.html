<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>New Applications / Unit Rosters</strong></p>
<p>We still have recent adult applications submitted on line which are pending due to missing COR or other signatures. In addition not every unit has submitted a roster to the District Executive. This is just a simple list of names. No need to go a lot of trouble, our hard working professional scouter will do the hard work. We need this to verify that everyone is properly in the system. If scouts or adults are not in the system it creates serious repercussions, please act today. We want our professional to concentrate on the program, not paperwork.
