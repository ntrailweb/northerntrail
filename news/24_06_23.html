<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Lazy Days of Summer: Don't Let Scouting Slip Away</strong></p>

<p>Some of us look back with regret, wishing we had continued with Scouting when we were young. Those of us who did continue are happy we did. It is hard for young scouts to see into the future and realize the long-term benefits that Scouting provides. Scouting isn't just about camping. You and the other adults in your unit need to "sell" scouting to the youth in your unit.</p>
<p>Preparing for campouts and navigating unexpected challenges builds resilience and sharpens problem-solving skills. Scouting provides opportunities to develop leadership abilities and gain confidence. Earning merit badges exposes scouts to a wide range of career possibilities.</p>
<p>As parents, we play a vital role in keeping scouts engaged. While it's important not to force participation, active involvement makes a big difference. Your participation presence signals that Scouting is valuable and worth prioritizing.</p>
<p>Talk up scouting and plan for fall events so your scout will be looking forward to these activities.</p>
<p>The skills and experiences they gain will serve them well throughout their lives. So, as you enjoy the summer, make sure Scouting remains a priority. Your scout will thank you later!
</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Signup for Summer Camp</strong></p><p>
<p>There are still openings available for both <a href="https://circleten.org/c/cub-scouts-program/feed?postTypeId=whatsNew"><strong>Cub Scouts</strong></a> <a href="https://circleten.org/c/scouts-bsa/feed?postTypeId=whatsNew"><strong>Scouts BSA</strong></a> and <a href="https://circleten.org/c/venturing-program/feed?postTypeId=whatsNew"><strong>Venturing age</strong></a> at Circle Ten Camps.  Take advantage of these opportunities for fun, skills development, leadership, teamwork, and self-reliance.</p> 

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">The Gathering 9/27-29/2024, TRJ</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The activity is for Venturing-aged youth only.  This includes any guests or Scouts BSA participants who are Venturing-aged (13 and graduated 8th grade or 14-20).</li>
<li>National has changed the rules for certain firearms.  The Gathering will also include Climbing, ATV, Horseback, Water Sports, Crate Climb, and many other fun activities.</li>
<li>Camping the weekend is encouraged.  Lunch is provided on Saturday.</li>
<li>We need crews to assist the VOA with planning the event - "many hands make light work."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Upcoming Training</strong></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024NYLTSession3">NYLT Session 3 & 4</a></strong> Camp James Ray, July 15-20, 2024</p>

<p>National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) is an exciting, action-packed six-day council-level program designed to provide Scouts in troops, crews, and ships with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home units and other situations demanding leadership of self and others. The course is designed for Scouts BSA members who are at least 13 years old, and for Venturers or Sea Scouts who are at least 13 years old and have completed eighth grade.</p>

<p>For many of us our YPT card will expire soon. Now is the time to go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> and take the on-line training. Get it done now before the rush. Without a current card you cannot participate in any scouting activity.</p>
