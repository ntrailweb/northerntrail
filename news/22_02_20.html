<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">A Look Back</strong></p>
<p>It’s a bit of a slow news week, so I thought I would talk about scouting past.  I fear repeating myself and for those who have heard these stories before, I apologize. My scouting life began back in a small town in Ohio and while many things are different today, some are very much the same.</p>
<p>As a cub scout we played games and worked on crafts. No camping, but we did have fun. As a scout I worked on advancement and attended summer camp.  Woodland Trails Scout Reservation is still hosting scouts today more than 50 years later. I completed the mile swim in the camp pool and earned my patch. I got my first taste of scouting and except for a few years in college, I have been scouting ever since.</p>
<p>Scouting has helped me tremendously with life skills and I can never completely repay the gift of time, talent and treasure provided by so many people years ago.  As you can tell, I am a believer in the program because it does make a difference.</p>
<p>Scouting is an investment in the future of our children, it is not about entertainment!</p> 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Need Volunteers for 2022 Venturing and Sea Scout Rendezvous</strong></p>
<p>Youth (ages 14 to 21) and adult volunteers are needed for the 2022 Venturing and Sea Scout Rendezvous that is to be held on March 18-20 at the Camp Wisdom.  Help is needed especially to run competition events such as clove-hitch tying, heaving-line skills, orienteering, scavenger hunt, etc.  It is a great opportunity to learn more about venturing and sea scouting programs in addition to earning volunteer hours.
