	<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Gratitude, a Core Scouting Value</strong></p>

<p>The twelfth point of the scout law: "A scout is Reverent."
Reverence implies being thankful for what we have and appreciation for parents, leaders, teachers and others in the community who help us as we travel the trail of life. </p>
<p>The scout slogan, "Do a good turn daily," demonstrates gratitude by giving back to the community.</p>
<p>Remind your scouts that Scouting is a gift, made possible by the time, talent, and generosity of leaders, parents, and the community.</p>
<p>Encourage your scouts to say "thank you" to leaders, fellow Scouts, and those who support their activities.</p>

	<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Powder Horn September 6-8, & 20-22, 2024</strong></p>
	<p>Powder Horn is a Resource Course designed to help you improve your unit’s older Scout outdoor and high adventure program. Powder Horn is an action-packed, hands-on, five-day course. Adult Leaders as well as Scouts ages 14 and older are eligible and encouraged to attend. There are no restrictions on attending the course a second time.</p>
	<p>Powder Horn is designed to introduce and expose troop, crew, and ship adult and youth leaders to activities and resources necessary to manage a successful outdoor or high adventure unit-level program. Originally designed to support the Venturing Ranger award, we have expanded the focus to help troops develop outdoor programs that challenge older (14+) Scouts.</p>
	<p>Powder Horn is a fun introduction to skills but does not train you to be an expert. Powder Horn provides an initial introduction to a variety of different high adventure activities and an introduction to working with consultants in delivering those programs. Units will still need to find knowledgeable, trained, and certified individuals to provide a safe and exciting outdoor high adventure program, but Powder Horn will show you how to do this. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024PowderHorn"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>
