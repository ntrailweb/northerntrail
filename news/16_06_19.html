<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Website Relocated</strong></p>

<p>The Northern Trail website has been moved and the old site will soon be deleted. You can still find it here: <a href="http://test.ntrail.org">http://test.ntrail.org</a>. Don't delay, because it will be gone very soon. If there is something which you think should be on the new site, please let me know as soon as possible. In the future photos will be posted to the Facebook page. The Facebook page may be found here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northerntrailbsa">https://www.facebook.com/northerntrailbsa</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Twilight Camp Wrapup</strong></p>

<p>We've created a page on the new website with information about Twilight Camp. It may be found here: <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-wrapup">http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-wrapup</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fall Activities</strong></p>

<p>Summer vacation will quickly pass and the new school year will be upon us. With the new school year comes, Join Scouting Night and Popcorn. If you have not identified leads for these two important events, please do so as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that in the Fall it will be necessary to get your Unit Re-chartered. This process can be simple or complicated. If you start early, it's not at all difficult. Wait until the last minute and it can be a real burden for everyone. Resist the temptation to put this off! Here is a handy checklist which will get you started! <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist">http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist</a>. Remember leaders must be trained for their respective positions and all registered adults must have up-to-date youth protection training.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for the re-charter, you can still help, get your required training done and pay any dues on time!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Summertime Pack Award</strong></p>

<p>A pack can earn the National Summertime Pack Award by doing three pack activities when school is out for the summerâ€”one activity each in June, July, and August. Packs that qualify get a colorful streamer for their pack flag. Dens that have at least half of their members at the three summer pack events can earn a den ribbon. Pack members who take part in all three events are eligible for the National Summertime Pack Award pin, to wear on the right pocket flap of their uniform. <a href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/33748.pdf">More Information.</a>
