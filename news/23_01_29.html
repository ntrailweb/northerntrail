<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Community Service and Passive Recruiting</strong></p>

		<p>Recently I read an <a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2023/01/09/passive-recruiting-what-it-is-and-how-you-can-make-it-work-for-you/"><strong>article</strong></a> in Scouting Magazine about passive recruiting. Years ago, when my boys were in scouts, our unit would sing holiday carols each year at a nursing home. The scouts would bring their band instruments and they would do their best to sing. We'd bring cookies and some punch. The scouts would visit with the residents and we always had a good time. One year we did not go and the following year we were told that they were so looking forward to our annual visit and were quite disappointed when we did not come. Clearly, we made a lot of very positive impressions in spite of our mediocre musical <nobr>ability&#128521;</nobr></p>
		
		<p>As the article points out, events like these often lead to new scouts for your unit. Sometimes in very indirect paths.</p>

		<p>Community service is part of being a scout, it's part of the oath and law. In addition to teaching your scouts what it means to be a scout, it can also lead to new scouts for your unit. Part of community service is making the gift of scouting available to youth in your community. </p>
