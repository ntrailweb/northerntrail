<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/fall-training">Election Day</a></strong></p>

<p>Election day is Tuesday November 8th. Boy Scout Roundtable, OA Chapter Meeting and Venturing Forum would normally be held on that date. For November only, these events will move to Thursday November 10th at the same location.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Roundtable</strong></p>

<p>Join Cub Scout Roundtable on Thursday November 10, 2016 at 7pm in room 211 at the First United Methodist Church in Richardson. Our topic is how to do flag ceremonies. Pack 728 will be joining us for the opening flag ceremony. If you want to bring your Cub Scouts and have them learn with the adults, this would be a perfect event. We will have a fun snack for adults and scouts to create together. The meeting will last only one hour but will be packed full of fun for all ages.</p>




<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">Adult Recognition</a></strong></p>

<p>This is the time of the year we think about who in Northern Trail should be recognized for their scouting efforts; this can be at the unit and/or district and council level.</p>

<p>At the unit level we have the Y.E.S.-Your Extraordinary Service Award, each unit can nominate 2 adults and 1 more for every additional 50 youth in the unit. Adults activity at district level- OA and District Committee can be nominated as well. The unit determines who receives the award.</p>

<p>The District Award of Merit is a council award presented by the district at their annual dinner. This person could have chaired one event or/and been involved in many scouting activities. A district committee selects the awardees from the nominations.</p>

<p>The Robert E. Little Award is a district award for long service to scouting. The district selects one person each year.</p>

<p>Additional information along with nomination forms for these three awards are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0</a> Additional supporting information can be included for the District Award of Merit and Robert E. Little awards. The deadline for each of these is Dec 1, 2016</p>

<p>The Silver Beaver is a the highest council award for scouters. The district gathers the nominations and forwards them to council. These scouters have made significant contributions to the scouting movement over a number of years. Additional information and forms are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award">northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award</a> Additional supporting information can be added. The deadline is Nov 1, 2016.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist">Re-Charter Time is Here</a></strong></p>

<p>It is time to re-charter your unit. Every adult must have a current Youth Protection card. Either the on-line version or the face-to-face version. Face-to-face is required for some activities like Twilight Camp and Summer Camp. Leaders must have specific training for their position. Start working re-charter now! If you are not in charge of recharter, help out the person who is by completing any needed training and paying your dues on time.<a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist">Re-charter Checklist</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/fall-training">Unit Leadership Contact Check</a></strong></p>

<p>Does your unit have a new Cubmaster or Scoutmaster? Has the contact information changed? If there is any doubt that we have the correct information, please let us know. Don't worry about duplicates, we will sort it out. <strong><em>I only got one response last week and I know there are many more changes than that!</em></strong></p> 

<p>Please take a moment and let us know the contact information for your unit Chair and Leader. We will match this information with what we have and verify the new information.
