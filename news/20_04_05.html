<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>COVID-19 and Advancement Dos and Don'ts</strong></p>
<p>Merit badges, boards of review, service projects are just some of the things that are more difficult than they were just a month ago. This is especially trying for Scouts who are rapidly approaching their 18th birthday.
Here are some things we can do, and a few we cannot do.
<ul>
<li>The Guide to Advancement says that boards of review should be done face to face. But it does allow video conferencing when face-to-face is not practical, and Social Distancing makes face-to-face boards less practical. Bryan on Scouting (<a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/03/16/how-to-conduct-a-board-of-review-through-videoconferencing/">https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/03/16/how-to-conduct-a-board-of-review-through-videoconferencing/</a>) has a good review of how to do this. These same rules can also apply to Scoutmaster conferences. </li>
<li>Circle Ten automatically approves a request to hold an Eagle BOR by video conference provided you know and follow the rules. They just need to know about it. Send the Scout's name, the unit type & # and the names & contact information for the members of the board of review to the District Advancement chair (<a href="mailto:BobFaulkner@IName.com">BobFaulkner@IName.com</a>) and he will consolidate and forward to council.</li>
<li>Other ranks do not need approval, but need to follow the rules.</li>
<li>COVID-19 is a temporary situation beyond a Scout's control, so it is possible to get an extension past age 18 to complete the Eagle requirements. These extensions are being granted at the Council level during this epidemic. To request one, sent the Scout's name, PID #, date of birth, and Unit Type & #, along with the phone # and email of the Unit Leader and a parent/guardian with a description of the circumstances that prevent completing the Eagle requirements prior to the Scout's 18th birthday TO the district advancement chair (<a href="mailto:BobFaulkner@IName.com">BobFaulkner@IName.com</a>). He will coordinate the request with Council.</li>
<li>Rank and merit badge requirements can NOT be changed. For example, if the requirement says "show", the scout must show that to the reviewer or merit badge counselor. Be as flexible as you can while still following the requirements as written. And, yes, some requirements may have to wait until after the epidemic is over.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Camp Cards</strong></p>

Contact our District Executive, Jorge Salazar if you have questions. <a href="mailto:Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org">Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org</a>

<p>Get signed up today to attend this course at Philmont this summer!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
