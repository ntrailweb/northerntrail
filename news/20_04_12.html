<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>COVID-19 Response</strong></p>
<p>The loss of life in New York and elsewhere has been horrific, but we are now seeing signs that the curve is bending.  There are still tough times ahead, but things are looking better. It's more critical than ever that we continue to follow official instructions and continue to be vigilant.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will soon begin to return to our activities and we are likely facing a new normal, but we will learn to deal with the challenges life throws at us.<br />

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Scouting For Food</strong></p>
<p>Since the inception of scouting in America, more than 100 years ago, scouts have risen to the challenge during national emergencies.  This has been demonstrated time and time again.  It's what we as scouts do.  A scout is helpful and kind!</p>
<p>Every year the scouts in Northern Trail collect thousands of pounds of food for Network of Community Ministries. Because of COVID-19 it is not possible at this time for the scouts to canvass the neighborhoods for food donations. Due to the pandemic, the number of clients the food bank is servicing has expanded greatly. There are many who have never needed help before who cannot feed their families. When there is a need scouting will find a way. <strong>Here is the plan:</strong><ul>
<li>Scouting families, when you shop, pick up items for the food bank and drop them off at the facility. When you arrive at the facility there will be someone to help you transfer the donation safely.</li>
<li>Contact others in your unit and challenge them to participate in this important effort.</li>
<li>Contact your neighbors by phone or email and encourage them to help the scouts deliver on the food drive.  Explain that normally you would be scouting for food but cannot because of the pandemic and could they please buy a few extra items when they shop and drop them by the food bank.</li>
<li>When you call your neighbors ask them to spread the word to the others they know to add momentum to the drive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together we can make a difference in the lives of families who are struggling due to the impact of the pandemic. When it is safe to do so we will have the normal food drive and there is no doubt the food bank will need additional food items.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15px;">Here is a shopping list:<br />
Fresh Produce <br />
Baking Goods (Flour, Sugar, Cooking Oil, pre-made mixes such as Bisquik and Jiffy) <br />
Canned Fruit (any variety) <br />
Jelly, Jams, and Spreads <br />
Canned Meat (chicken, chili, tuna, etc.) <br />
Canned Pasta <br />
Bottled Water (for volunteers) <br />
Hygiene Products (soap, shampoo, toilet paper, feminine hygiene products, deodorant, tooth paste, toothbrushes, facial tissues, laundry detergent, and cleaning supplies)</p>

<P>About Twilight Camp: Cub Scout Leaders, Cub Scout Parents, and Cub Scouts may be wondering if we are going to have twilight camp this year. The short answer is YES! Right now, the COVID-19 restrictions are scheduled to end on April 30. The staff does not have a crystal ball to know what will happen then, but we are going forward with preparations for the full Twilight Camp and making sure we have alternative plans. We and Circle Ten Council will be monitoring the situation up till the start of camp. One Wednesday, April 29, Circle Ten Council will be hosting a Zoom meeting at 6:30 P.M. for all Cub Leaders, parents, or anyone else interested in Twilight Camp. Information about how to join this meeting should be made available sometime this week.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend this course at Philmont this summer!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
