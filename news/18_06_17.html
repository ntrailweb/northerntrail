<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Why I'm still a Scouter, By James Wells</strong></p>
<p>What really moved me to become a Scouter was my first trip to summer camp at Camp Constantin. The boys needed rides. I volunteered, and on a Sunday morning in early June, we drove to Possum Kingdom Lake where I was introduced to summer camp. My intention was to drop the boys off and then head home, but their excitement made me stay until they went to dinner.</p>
<p>While helping set up the campsite, I noticed one boy was following me everywhere. Every time I turned around, he would be right behind me watching what I was doing, and doing what he could to learn how to do it. I would encourage him to go hang out with his friends, but he stuck with me all day. And when it came time for me to leave, he begged me to stay.</p>
<p>In the middle of the afternoon, I had found my son and asked him about this boy. It turned out he didn’t have a Dad. His mother was a single parent, a great one, but the boy needed a dad. Then my son said, “it looks like you’re it, Dad.”</p>
<p>At that moment I was hooked. That was in 1987. I still can’t leave scouts because I realized on that day that being a good role model for young “soon to be” men, even for those who do have great Dad’s, is so important. 
It takes a village to raise a child. Scouts is a great village.</p>
<p>That’s my story.</p>

<p>We now have only one approved Youth Protection Certificate and everyone will have to have the <strong>new</strong> card by October 1st. To protect not only our youth, but adult volunteers as well, this course has been updated to clearly define how we implement the program. For Summer camp this year, a valid Face-to-Face YPT card will be acceptable, but will be invalid after <strong>October 1st 2018.</strong> If you need an approved card for Summer Camp, take the course at <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. Here are some <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/ypt-training-tips">YPT Training Tips</a> to make the process a little easier. </p>
<p>Now is a great time to get needed training completed and out of the way. Hazardous Weather Training is required for front line leaders. There are a world of on-line training courses available on <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. A great example is the driving safety course. Even with more than fifty years of driving, I learned a few good tips watching this class. Remember you can't re-charter your unit unless every adult has the undated YPT training certificate. Avoid the rush, get it done now. <p>Questions can be emailed to <a href="mailto:571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org">571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org</a>.</p>
