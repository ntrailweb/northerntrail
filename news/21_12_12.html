<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Adult Recognition</strong></p>
<p>We are behind in the number of nominations this year. This is partly due to some problems with our website which have been resolved. The deadline has been extended to Friday of this week. Please take just a few moments to nominate someone in your unit who has made difference. Forms may be found <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html">here.</a>



<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Electronic Communications with Scouts</strong></p>
<p>Many leaders routinely communicate with scouts and scouters via phone, email, text, and other similar tools. It is important to remember that such communication must follow the same two deep leadership rules as in-person interactions. You should remind your scouts to include a parent or other adult leader in any communications they initiate. Additionally, when you communicate or reply to a scout, you must include another adult leader in the conversation. This could be a parent, scoutmaster or other adult leader familiar with everyone include in the conversation. This will keep you in compliance with the YPT protocols and help keep everyone safe at the same time.</p> 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>As of December 10, 19 Northern Trail District units have not started the recharter process. Every unit’s charter expires on December 31. The recharter process is simpler than it has been in the past and by uploading documents and paying online, you can avoid a trip to a council office. The process even allows for the gathering of required signatures online. Let’s get started now and be 100% rechartered on January 1. For more help, contact you Unit Commissioner.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for the re-charter process you are still responsible to get your training up to date and any dues paid. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Youth Protection Training</span> is required for all adults and must be completed every two years.</p>
<p>Any questions or problems please contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Religious Emblems</strong>
<p>Make earning religious emblems part of your program. Just about every faith tradition has a religious emblem. The religious emblems program is recognized by BSA as a way for Scouts in all age groups to develop a deeper understanding of their faith. To get started, speak with your spiritual advisor or visit <a href="https://www.scouting.org/awards/religious-awards/">https://www.scouting.org/awards/religious-awards/</a>.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Add the District Calendar to your Calendar</strong> </p>
<p>Go to the calendar <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/calendar.php?OrgKey=BSA571&view=2&id=1555&cat=&loc=&cty=&header=1&useHover=1&useTickler=1&useOfficeClosing=1&filterDistrict=1&filterCategory=1&filterCamp=1&filterCounty=1&allowChange=1&showDays=365&month=&year=">here.</a> When in Calendar, click on the "Subscribe" button on the top right corner. It will give you an option to which calendar you'd like to subscribe it to. I tested with Google Calendar, followed the steps there and it showed all district activities together with my personal calendar. You can use different colors for the district activities to differentiate from your personal/work entries. Thanks to Muhammad Ikram for this tip.</p>
