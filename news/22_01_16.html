<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Experiences of a Lifetime</strong></p>
<p>Thirty years ago this spring, my son and I went on a Philmont trek. The memory is still fresh in my mind today. My son recently recalled the experience and he too savors the memories. Not every scouting activity may reach the level of Philmont, but all of them are memorable in their own ways. Special in that they are out of the ordinary. They can inspire, humble and delight. Scouting is special, seize the moment, before you know it, decades will have passed.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Camp Cards</strong></p>
<p>Camp Cards are a great way for scouts to earn money towards camp and other scouting activities. Camp Cards are easy to sell and are a great value. This year both Tom Thumb and Albertsons will be on the card.</p>
<p><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021CampCardKickoff">Here</a> is the signup link. Unit leaders, please signup for the kickoff at a convenient location for you. Questions to our District Executive, Katherine McCrary at <a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a></p>
