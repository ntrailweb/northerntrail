<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouts Deserve Trained Leaders and <i>Parents</i></strong></p>
<p>Training is an integral part of the scout program and for good reason. Training ensures that the program is delivered correctly, leveraging the combined experience of hundreds of volunteers and professionals who have worked out the best methods to achieve scouting goals.</p>
<p>In addition to delivering the program as intended, training is essential, no required to ensure that scouts experience a safe and enjoyable scouting experience. To this end every registered adult must be youth protection trained every two years, so everyone is clear on the operating principles which are designed to protect both the scouts and the adult volunteers. In addition to youth protection training, scouting offers training in just about every conceivable scouting activity. Position training will provide both leaders and parents the information they need to help scouts get the most from the program.</p>
<p>Because of the changes a few years ago the majority of the adults in Circle Ten will need to take Youth Protection in 2020. Avoid the rush get it done today. You can find youth protection training on-line at <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. While there you can check out other courses and check your personal training record.</p>

<p>In addition to on-line training Northern Trail offers in-person training. Coming up this fall are two programs worth considering. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scoutmasterassistant-specific-introduction-outdoor-leader-skills">Adult Leaders Specific / Outdoor Leaders Specific</a> training ALS/OLS and <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/back-country-advanced-training">Backcountry Advanced Training</a> BAT. ALS/OLS training is a comprehensive deep dive in the Scouting BSA program and details every aspect of how a scout troop operates with emphasis on how the scouts are provided the opportunity to lead. This training includes an outdoor camping activity which will give you the confidence to take your unit camping and be successful. BAT is designed to prepare both older scouts and adults to participate in high adventure activities such as Philmont.</p>

<p>BAT is an interactive course designed for those Individuals and Units who are preparing for a high-adventure trek and for those interested in organizing first time backcountry activities for their Unit. The course is titled “Leave the Trailer Behind!” and is directed towards Individuals and Units that want to introduce more backpacking to their annual program. This is a great opportunity as a Unit activity for new or seasoned backpackers or to prepare for future backpacking treks. Two classroom sessions are followed by a weekend backpacking camp-out adventure. The course features information and instruction detailing trek preparation, crew dynamics, and techniques of backpacking - hiking, camping, and preparing meals on the trail. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/back-country-advanced-training">Read more and register.</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>School Night For Scouting</strong></p>
<p>This is the time of year that we focus on recruiting. Our scouts grow up and move on to adulthood and it's critical that new scouts come in to replace them. With new scouts come new parents and from these new parents a new generations of leaders. To keep delivering the promise of scouting we must recruit! School rallies are now being scheduled and every unit will need to help with the new recruits. If you have questions, please contact Jorge Salazar <a href="mailto:Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org">Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org</a> (214)-738-3418.</p>
