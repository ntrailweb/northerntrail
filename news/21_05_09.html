<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Loyal</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>From the Scout Handbook - "A Scout is loyal. A Scout is true to his family, friends, Scout leaders, school, and nation. Loyalty means to be faithful. When we say a Scout is Loyal, it means he or she remains steadfast in adherence to what is right." Loyalty is a key element providing direction for character. Leaders, remind your scouts what it means to be loyal.</p>

<p><img align="left" hspace="5" style="max-width:30%; float:left; margin:5px;" src="https://ntrail.org/images/tent.avif"></p>Summer camp is the experience of a lifetime. Young people only have a few years to experience summer camp and the memories and skills will last a lifetime. I don't remember a lot about those years, however decades later I remember summer camp clearly.

<p>Circle Ten has programs this summer to fit your schedule and interests. Camps are filling fast, so claim your spot.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/80636/maverick-camp">Maverick</a> program has been expanded, so if you cannot go with your troop, you can still attend camp.

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Friends of Scouting</strong></p>

<p>A scout is helpful. The program needs your help. Due to the reduction in unit meetings over the past year, we have not been able to get the message out about the critical need to fund the scout program. The program will continue, but without adequate funds, we can not deliver the quality program that our scouts deserve. Many scout units in the district who have helped out in the past are not represented in the current fund raising campaign including the vital Popcorn and Camp Card programs.</p> 

<p>There is still time to help with support scouting. If you can help, please consider making a pledge or an additional pledge. You can do it <a href="https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021">online.</a>

<p>The 50% commission deadline has passed. Profits go to 35%, which is still a great fundraising return for setting up a table for a few hours in front of your favorite store, with permission of course. We hope to continue to improve this program, so please Text Jill @ (843) 290-5595 and let her know why you do, why you don't, sell. We need responses from all Units please.</p>
