<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">All BSA COVID Advancement changes Removed in March of 2022</strong></p>
<p>All BSA COVID Advancement changes removed in March 2022.
On Dec 29, 2021, the BSA announced that all the temporary modifications to BSA requirements necessitated by COVID-19 will be removed effective March 1, 2022 and the standard rules for advancement and merit badges will again become effective. This specifically affects the following advancements and merit badges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any outstanding deferred swimming requirements from 2nd or 1st Class must now be fulfilled for any rank advancement that occurs on or after March 1, 2022.</li>
<li>Scouts earning their 2nd or 1st Class rank on or after March 1 will have to fulfill the original, pre-COVID requirements. The same is true for Sea Scout swimming requirements for rank advancement.</li>
<li>Starting on March 1, Scouts must complete requirement 9b of the Camping MB, unless they have already competed the MB prior to March 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see <a href="https://www.scouting.org/coronavirus/covid-19-faq/">https://www.scouting.org/coronavirus/covid-19-faq/</a> for a full reference.</p>
<p>This does not affect Eagle Scout extension requests. If Covid-19 facts and circumstances (in 2020-21) delayed a Scout along the path to any rank, to the point they run out of time before their 18th birthday, those factors can still be sited as valid reasons for an Eagle extension. Contact Advancement Chair Bob Faulkner <a href="mailto:bobfaulkner@iname.com">bobfaulkner@iname.com</a> if you have questions.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Camp Cards</strong></p>
