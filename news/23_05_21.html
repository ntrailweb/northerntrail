		<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Volunteer Time is Valuable</p>
<p>Scouting only exists because of the tireless efforts of volunteers. Like any source of labor, the services provided by volunteers are extremely valuable, but it is easy to discount this value because it does not directly impact an organization's budget. One of the most important things we can do is to keep our volunteers informed. Questions will come up and answers can be difficult to come by, but we can still inform with what we know. Too often questions go unanswered when information is not available. Just making the connection makes it clear that the channel is working, and the goals and needs are still present. If volunteers do not know, they cannot help and more importantly may find other places to allocate their time.</p>
<p>Finally, there is nothing more motivating than one-on-one communication. Personal communication is much more likely to get results.</p>
