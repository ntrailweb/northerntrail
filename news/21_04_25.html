<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>While not specifically one of the elements of the oath and law, it is woven into these principles and the scouting program. Showing up in the proper uniform and prepared to participate in a meeting is one example. Carefully planning and preparing for a campout with the proper equipment is another. Patrol leaders must take responsibility for their patrols and ensure that events are properly planned. Will scouts fall short of these things? Of course, but with practice and repeated experiences they will improve and accept responsibility. Responsible scouts become responsible adults and responsible adults are better life partners, employees, and citizens. Scouting is about building character and it is a process.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Congratulations, you have achieved the rank of Life Scout!</strong></p>
<p><img style="float:right; margin:4px;" src="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/clipart/eagle_patch.jpg">Now what? Well, of course, you need 6-months as an active Scout and 6-months of leadership to progress to the next rank (EAGLE!). You also must check off all the requirements of the Eagle Scout Application (Download it from this page: <a href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/eagle-scout-rank/">https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/eagle-scout-rank/</a>). While you are in that web site, READ that cover page from top to bottom. Always get your application and project workbook from links available on this page. That way you know you have the most current versions (a key factor) before you start getting signature approvals. <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/eagle_preparation.htm">Continue reading.</a></p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Get Scout Active</strong></p>
<p>The COVID infection rate is way down from the peak. Over 200 million vaccinations have been given. Procedures are in place to deliver scouting in a safe manner. Summer camp is particularly safe. Don't wait, get active now!</p> 
<p>Here is a chart of the estimated daily infections and testing for Dallas County. You can see that the trends are in the right direction.

<p>Twilight camp is a week-long late afternoon, early evening event for Cub Scouts. The theme for Twilight Camp this year is "Weird Science." Lots of fun activities are planned in a COVID safe environment. This event will be held, as in the past, at Breckinridge Park in Northeast Richardson. BB guns, archery, crafts, games, egg drop, swaps and more. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NTTwilightCamp">Registration</a> now available. Check out pictures from past Twilight Camps <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/forms-and-more.html#pictures">here</a>. Another benefit is that as an adult, you will enjoy the activity and meet other parents dealing with the many of the same challenges you are facing.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT">National Youth Leadership Training</a></strong></p>
<p>National Youth Leadership Training is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home troops and in other situations demanding leadership of self and others.</p>
<p>The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO. The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT">Learn more</a>.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Friends of Scouting</strong></p>

<p>It has been a really tough year for everyone. Some more so than others. All of us have suffered due to lack of social interactions with friends and colleagues. Scouting has suffered, it has been more difficult to deliver the program. Everyone is adapting, however Circle Ten has suffered financially as well. It takes money to care for our camps, offices and pay the dedicated professionals who work hard to create the environment needed to deliver the program. Many of us have stepped up and dug a little deeper to fill the gap, but we are still short of what is needed to keep the council financially healthy.</p>
<p>If you can help, please consider making a pledge or an additional pledge. You can do it <a href="https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021">online.</a>
