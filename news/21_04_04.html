<h2>Plan for Summertime Scouting</h2>

<p><img align="right" style="width:30%"; src="https://www.ntrail.org/images/weird-science.png"><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Twilight Camp 2021, June 14-18, 2021</strong>
<p>Twilight camp is a week-long late afternoon, early evening event for Cub Scouts. The theme for Twilight Camp this year is "Weird Science." Lots of fun activities are planned in a COVID safe environment. This event will be held as in the past at Breckinridge Park in Northeast Richardson. BB guns, archery, crafts, games, egg drop, swaps and more. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NTTwilightCamp">Registration</a> now available. Check out pictures from past Twilight Camps <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/forms-and-more.html#pictures">here</a>. Another benefit is that as an adult, you will enjoy the activity and meet other parents dealing with the many of the same challenges you are facing.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Summer Camp</strong></p>
<p>Summer camp is key to the scouting experience. Circle Ten has programs this summer to fit your schedule and interests. Camps are filling fast, so claim your spot.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/24191/maverick-camp-2020">Maverick</a> program has been expanded so if you cannot go with your troop, you can still attend camp.</p>
<p><a href="https://circleten.org/posts/1209/camp-constantin2">Information and Registration for Camp Constantine</a><br />
<a href="https://circleten.org/posts/1220/trevor-rees-jones-scout-camp">Information and Registration for Camp Trevor Rees-Jones</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Unit Summertime Activities</strong></p>
<p>It has been a challenging year for scouting and with the improving conditions it is time to rekindle your scouting program. This is the perfect time of year for outdoor activities and these activities are much safer than indoor activities. So, plan for unit activities during the summer. Get creative and plan to get your unit together during the summer.</p>

<h2>Training for Adults</h2>

<p>Scouting is a unique concept, and the <a href="https://troopleader.scouting.org/scoutings-aims-and-methods/">aims and methods</a> are not immediately obvious. It can be a little overwhelming to someone new. This problem has been addressed and there is a wealth of training available to help ensure the success or your child and unit.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable</strong></p>
<p>Roundtables are for all scouting adults, parents and leaders. At these events you will learn methods and techniques to help your scout and unit be successful. Our next Roundtable will be held this coming Thursday, April 8th at 7:30pm</p> 

<p><strong>Roundtable Topic</strong></p>

<p>The number one cause of death behind car accidents of people under the age of 25 is suicide. With the lockdowns and lack of social interaction cause by covid, the suicide prevention hotlines in parts of the country saw an 8,000% increase in traffic.</p>

<p>Our next roundtable will play host to mental health professionals to discuss this and other mental health issues relevant to scouting, Join us at 7:30 on Thursday April, 8 on Zoom for this discussion and to learn about how we can provide hope to those who need it most.</p>

<h2>Training for Scouts</h2>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT">National Youth Leadership Training</a></strong></p>
<p>National Youth Leadership Training is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home troops and in other situations demanding leadership of self and others.</p>
<p>The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO. The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT">Learn more</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Opportunities</h2>

<p><img style="width:30%;" align="right" src="https://www.scouting.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EPA-Award-Logo-3.jpg"><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">50th Anniversary Environmental Protection Agency Award</strong></p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency, as part of a public awareness campaign to celebrate its first 50 years, has partnered with the Boy Scouts of America to create an award for members of troops, crews and ships. This new award will recognize youth who research and learn about the subjects of human health and the environment, as the EPA develops its vision for the next 50 years. <a href="https://www.scouting.org/outdoor-programs/trail-to-adventure/50th-anniversary-environmental-protection-agency-award/#:~:text=50th%20Anniversary%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency%20Award%20The%20Environmental,award%20for%20members%20of%20troops,%20crews%20and%20ships.">More information and an application.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://circleten.org/posts/38211/religious-emblem-program">Religious Emblem Program</a></strong></p>
<p>The religious emblems programs are programs created by the various religious groups to encourage youth to grow stronger in their faith. The religious groups - not Boy Scouts of America - have created the religious emblems programs themselves. Contact Hank Voegtle <a href="mailto:hankusv@gmail.com">hankusv@gmail.com</a> if you have questions.</p>

<h2>Fund Raising</h2>

<p>Like it or not, any organization requires funds to make it operate. Scouting is a very efficient operation with volunteer leaders who do the heavy lifting. We have camps, offices and professional scouters who provide essential services. These professionals represent a small fraction of the total. Funds are raised in several ways including fees, popcorn sales, camp cards and direct contributions from individuals and groups. All these income sources have declined due to COVID has this has placed a severe strain on the organization and it is vital that we make an extra effort to get back on track.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Friends of Scouting</strong></p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we need robust programs to teach the next generation life skills learned by being involved in Scouting. FOS funding helps us to provide all Scouts with worthwhile activities and valuable resources including our top-notch facilities. Please consider one of the following FOS giving options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going on-line today and making a personal contribution (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021">https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021</a> please enter "Northern Trail" in the district name field!)</li>

<li>Reaching out to your employer for corporate matching funds.</li>

<li>Volunteering to help with our fundraising efforts through networking including social media.</li>

<li>Inviting one of our FOS speakers to your next Scouting event such as a Blue & Gold or Court of Honor.</li>
</ul>
<p>***If your pack, troop, crew or ship is only holding virtual events, we would love a chance to speak during your next online meeting.***
