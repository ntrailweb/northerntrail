<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://circleten.org/youth-protection-training-update">Youth Protection Training Important Update</a></strong></p>
<p>It is official, the current 2018 Online Youth Protection Training meets state requirements and has been approved by the State of Texas.</p>
<p>If you have completed the new BSA online Youth Protection Training course on or after March 13, 2018, you no longer need to take a classroom-facilitated version of the course to attend a licensed camp (camps of four or more days).</p> 
<p>If you have not taken the <strong>new</strong> BSA online Youth Protection Training course, you must do so by <strong>October 1, 2018</strong>. or you won’t be able to re-charter with your unit.</p>
<p>If you have a valid Face-to-Face card, it will be accepted for Twilight Camp and Summer Camp this year.</p>
<p>Questions can be emailed to  <a href="mailto:571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org">571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org</a>.</p>
<p>So take the time to complete this course and get it out of the way for the fall.  While you are at it, take the Hazardous Weather Training. Before you start, here are some tips which will make the process a little easier. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/ypt-training-tips">YPT Training Tips</a>

<p><img align="left" hspace="5" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/ww_2018_small.png">Here is a great opportunity to get help up and coming Boy Scouts get a great launch into the Boy Scout program. Troops are needed to help staff this event. If you are interested in staffing, please attend the planning meeting in FUMC-R, room 225, 7-8:30 pm May 16, June 20, July 25, Aug. 15 and Sept. 12.
The theme for Webelos Woods is “Scout Skills”. Scout Troops are encouraged to volunteer for STAFF in the following areas:  Compass, First Aid (making kits),  Knife & Axe (safe use and cleaning), Dutch Oven Cooking, First Aid bandage ( using neckerchief), Tug- a-war,  String Burning, Campsite inspections, and other events TBD.  Remember the idea is to have experienced scouts STAFF these areas and not Adults.  
Cost for event has been set at $10.00 for Cub and Cub Adult.
Cubs and Scout Troops provide their own food.
