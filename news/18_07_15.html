<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>All Scouts Deserve Trained Leaders</strong></p>
<p>This is a phrase we’ve often heard, but there are other reasons to get trained. I’ve learned that most of us overestimate our ability, but underestimate our ability to learn new things.  We may think we understand how the program works and the best way to implement it, but in reality there are things we think we know but in fact don’t know!  Training not only fills in the gaps and helps us to be more efficient, but it also provides the catalyst that can help parents or leaders internalize the real value of the program beyond just another activity for their scouts.</p>
<p>So if you are parent of a scout, consider getting some training, you will gain a better understanding of the program and your child will benefit from that knowledge.
If you are a leader in a unit, training is a must and in addition to your own training you need to be proactive and encourage other adults in your unit to go to training.  No don’t just encourage, send them to training.</p>
<p>We have a number training opportunities coming up in the fall and they are on the calendar.  Now is the time to put them on the schedule and plan to attend and send others as well.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation, BALOO</strong></p>

<p>BALOO training is an introduction to the Cub Scout outdoor program. BSA’s Cub Scout level camping policies will be taught along with the necessary tools to help units carry out a successful camping experience.</p>
<p>BSA requires that at least one adult on a Pack overnighter be BALOO trained. Webelos Den Leaders camping as a den must be BALOO trained.</p>
<p>Who should attend -- Cubmasters, Assistant Cubmasters, Den Leaders, Interest Adult Leaders</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>SM/ASM  Leader Specific Training</strong></p>

<p>"Scoutmaster/Assistant Specific" training is a two evening course which will expand on and clarify your understanding of the Scout program. The course addresses how and, most importantly, why Scouting works and will help you to insure the success of your scouts in your unit. This course is for all Unit Leaders, including Parents and Committee members. This class meets on two Wednesday evenings - Sept 26, 2018 & Oct 3, 2018 <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scoutmasterassistant-specific-introduction-outdoor-leader-skills">More information</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills</strong></p>

“Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills” training is a companion course to Scoutmaster/Assistant Specific. This is a hands-on campout where you participate as your scout would in the actual planning and execution of a scout campout while advancing towards the rank of First Class. You will learn by doing at the direction of our experienced leadership team. Expect to learn a lot while having a very enjoyable experience. Advance registration and preparation is required.

<p>We now have only one approved Youth Protection Certificate and everyone will have to have the <strong>new</strong> card by October 1st. To protect not only our youth, but adult volunteers as well, this course has been updated to clearly define how we implement the program.  For Summer camp this year, a valid Face-to-Face YPT card will be acceptable, but will be invalid after <strong>October 1st 2018.</strong>  If you need an approved card for Summer Camp, take the course at <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>.
