		</ul>
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Camping gear, you need less than you think</p>
<p>I've done a lot of backpacking in the wilderness areas of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.</p><p>When you embark on a trip into the back country for a week, you think very carefully about what items to bring. The old adage, <i><strong>an ounce in the morning is a pound at night</strong></i> is very true, I know from personal experience!</p>
<p>We quickly learned to weigh our packs and take out unnecessary items. Philmout trekkers are familiar with the pack weighing process and the removal of unneeded items. A 50 pound pack on young scout is a really bad idea. In truth every time I go I take fewer items!</p>
<p>One popular weekend scouting idea is a "shoe box" campout. The idea is that everything except your sleeping bag and water bottle must fit in a standard shoe box with the lid in place. You can wear your coat and poncho. It's a fun activity and the scouts learn to make some hard choices about what to bring along.</p>
<p>Camping gear can be expensive, but in truth there is a ton of forgotten camping gear right in your neighborhood, most of which could be had inexpensively or even free, if you just ask around. You don't need the most expensive pack and camp gadgets. The truth is you will need some camping experience before you really know what you want and need.</p>
<p>I will emphasize that for serious hiking, good quality well fitting boots are essential. A high percentage of first time buyers will get boots which are too small. A properly adjusted pack is far more important than the dollars spent. A poorly fitting pack can be very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Happy camping!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership + Recruiting</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>School Night for Scouting:</strong>  Fall recruiting is still in process. Northern Trail has done well so far, but we are not done yet.  If you can help or need information, please contact Katherine McCrary at 	<a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org"><strong>Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</strong></a>.</li>

<li><strong>Retain New Members:</strong> Pack Unit Leaders, ensure that you are following-up with every prospective parent that signed-in on the attendance rosters from your SNFS events. Many parents prefer to go home and discuss with their spouse, so it's essential for them to get a personal phone call shortly after. Ask them if they're still interested in joining your pack!</li>

<li><strong>Grow your Membership:</strong>
You may not be participating in SNFS, but that doesn't mean you can't grow your unit's membership. You should always be looking for opportunities to recruit more scouts into the program! Pack and troop leaders, if you'd like to hold a fall recruitment event for your unit, the council can assist you in promoting it. Email <a href="mailto:katherine.mccrary@scouting.org"><strong>katherine.mccrary@scouting.org</strong></a> to create and print fliers to be distributed in your community.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>Even if you are not responsible for submitting the recharter paperwork, everyone in the unit has the responsibility to pay their dues and take any required training.  The unit cannot be rechartered if any adult on the roster does not have a current youth protection training card. Easy to get, just go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> and take the training. While you are there take the opportunity to check out other great training opportunities.</p> 
<p>The process of rechartering a unit can be bit overwhelming. Like any task, if you break it up into bite-sized pieces you can it done. It can't be completed until all of the steps are done.</p>
<p>The next <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/?OrgKey=BSA571&calendarID=388736"><strong>Roundtable</strong></a> on October 26th at 7:00PM will focus on the process in detail. Questions will be answered and commonly made mistakes will be identified. The key is to start now and start working your checklist.</p>
<p>The recharter process will remain the same for this year, Committee Chairs, start gathering your recharter dues! Exclusion: any scouts that have joined starting August 1st have already paid their fees.</p>
<p>New information on 2023 recharter: If you have an existing scout that will need financial assistance on their 2024 recharter fees, you must ensure 2 things as the unit leader</p>
<op>
<li>That the individual family submits their FA form BY December 1st.</li>
<li>The unit needs to have submitted their recharter by December 1st as well. It does not need to be "final," meaning you may still have defectives and/or add-ons. But, the actual unit recharter itself will need to have been submitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendance is highly encouraged by the Committee Chair and/or unit leader that will coordinate their unitâ€™s 2024 recharter.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Popcorn</strong></p>
<p>Get out and sell popcorn. It benefits your unit and is vital to supporting our camps and the council operations. Scouts become a part of this process and it is part of learning the value of of the program.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">Fall Adult Leadership Training (ALT) â€“ October 28, 8:15-4:00pm @ FUMCR</p>
<p>The Adult Leader Training is for any interested Adult who would learn more about the Aims and Methods of Scouting BSA. This course is recommended for all Unit Leaders, including Parents and Committee Members. all Unit Leaders, including Parents and Committee Members.</p>
<p>The course addresses how and, most importantly, why Scouting works and will help you to ensure the success of the scouts & your unit. Every young person in the Scouting program needs and deserves a leader who understands the aims of the program and knows how to deliver it with enthusiasm and funâ€”in short, a trained leader. Because they understand their role, trained leaders have a positive influence on the lives of youth. How well we influence the lives of these youth depends on their leaders' understanding of the program and their responsibilities.</p>

<p>The ALT Course is Part 1 of becoming a fully trained leader.  Part 2 is completing the Introduction to Outdoor Leadership Skills Course (IOLS).  <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023CWFallTrainingEvent"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to register for the November IOLS course.</p>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">BALOO</p>
<p>BALOO is one of the required training's for a Pack to do overnight Pack camping events. The Pack must have one leader with this training on any Pack camp out but it is recommended that Packs have several leaders with the training to make sure all Pack camp outs can be covered. This training is designed for adults over 21 who are registered as an adult leader in a Cub Scout Pack, but other adults can attend. It focuses on using the learning environment (aka camping) to teach your Scouts and parents about camping, assisting the Pack with campout planning, and to strengthen the Pack program on campouts.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">Introduction To Outdoor Leadership Skills (IOLS)</p>
<p>IOLS is required for all direct contact leaders (Scoutmasters and Assistant Scoutmasters) in Scouts BSA Troops to be considered a TRAINED LEADER. It is also beneficial to Committee Chairs and Troop members as it provides a better understanding of Scout BSA's outdoor program. Aside from covering some basic camping and outdoor information, this training covers an experiential learning of the Patrol method used by Scouts BSA troops. Scoutmasters and Assistant Scoutmasters will need to have completed the Scoutmaster Position Specific Training modules and be current for Youth Protection Training to receive a TRAINED patch at the end of the course. These online training's can be found at my.scouting.org.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops (ILST)</p>

ILST is the first course in the series of leadership training offered to Scouts and is a replacement for Troop Leadership Training. The next course in the series is National Youth Leadership Training.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">Prerequisites</p>
<p>You will need to do pre-course work in my.scouting.org for either IOLS or BALOO or attend an in-person ALT training, need to have your position training (Scoutmaster, Assitant Scoutmaster, Cubmaster, Den Leader,  or Committee Chair) and have current Youth Protection Training to earn your Coveted "Trained" patch.
