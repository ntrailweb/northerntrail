<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Have Cubs Crossing Over to Scouts BSA?</strong></p>
<p>Crossover season is underway and there are key things that packs and troops should know:<br />
For Packs-all youth Cub Scout awards need to be recorded and uploaded through Scoutbook or internet advancement BEFORE youth are registered in a troop. Once a youth is registered in a troop, Cub Scout advancement will not be able to be recorded at the unit level (without a lot of trouble).</p>
<p>For Packs and Troops-if a Cub Scout was registered in a Pack at the time he or she crosses over, use the BSA transfer form, <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/524-401WB.pdf">filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/524-401WB.pdf</a>, this will keep their records intact and avoid having to pay the $60 youth registration fee again. </p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Internet Advancement Access for Councils and Units</strong></p>

<p>The new Internet Advancement web platform is specially designed for both council employees and unit leaders to track and record unit advancements. The platform was built to optimize unit management and includes features that enable council employees or leaders to record the same advancement for many youth at once.</p>
<p>You don't have to wait to try out this new tool because Internet Advancement is now FIELD READY and optimized so you can use your mobile device or desktop to review the progress of your council's units.</p>
<p>How to Access Internet Advancement<br />
1.	Visit and bookmark https://scoutbook.scouting.org/login<br />
2.	Log in with your my.scouting account tied to your council role or unit position<br />
