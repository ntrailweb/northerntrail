<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024UniversityofScouting"><strong>Camping, an Essential Part of Scouting</strong></a></p>
<p>
One of the methods of scouting is participation in outdoor activities. When we think about scouting and the outdoors we think about camping and hiking. Camping provides many opportunities for growth. First, it takes scouts out of their comfort zone and puts them into situations where they will need to plan carefully for successful outings. Additionally, it provides a safe opportunity for failure. Yes failure, going camping and enduring bad food, getting wet and maybe a little cold is great training for life. None of these things are dangerous but they are instructive. If we protect our scouts from every mistake, then they lose out on the opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>Those of us who have watched many scouts go from Tenderfoot to Eagle scout have observed firsthand the evolution, experienced scouts figure out how to manage in these situations and become very adept. 
Troops should plan monthly campouts and long-term summer camps as part of their program. Not every scout will be able to participate in all of the campouts, but with monthly campouts most will have the opportunity to attend several during the scout year.</p>
<p>Summer camp provides scouts the opportunity to take the skills from weekend campouts to the next level and gain experiences not possible with weekend campouts. Merit badges, aquatic activities, equestrian adventures and more are part of summer camp.</p>
<p>High adventure camps like Philmont are life changing activities which will test the mettle of scouts and provide experiences not available to most youth. Every scout should aspire to at least one high adventure activity during their scouting career.</p>
<p>Camping is more than entertainment; it is an essential part of the scouting program and provides and opportunity for personal growth, skill development and resourcefulness.

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter</p>
<p>Your re-charter should be done, but if not please get it completed as soon as possible. If your unit leadership is scrambling to get it done, please do your part by completing any necessary training or paperwork today. Late re-charters are hard on everyone.</p>
<p>If you need assistance, help is available. Your unit commissioner or the district executive will be happy to answer any questions about the process. By the way the details of how to get it done may be found <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Please don't let your charter lapse. Your scouts are depending on you to get it done and keep your unit functioning.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>Winter Camp Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp</strong></a> December 27-31, 2023</strong></p>
<p>If your unit has never participated in Winter Camp this is the year to change that. It's lots of fun and we guarantee it won't be "hot."</p>
<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA Troops, Venturing Crews, and Sea Scout Ships. It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.</p>
<p>Units camp jamboree style with multiple Units in a single campsite. The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards. Food is prepared by each Unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ). <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>More information.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024Rendezvous">Rendezvous 2024</strong></a></p>
<p>March 8-10 (most activities on the 9th). Registered Venturers, Sea Scouts, and Explorer Post members are invited. We will be inviting people from the entire NST 8 (National Service Territory) this year and are hoping to restore the event to pre-COVID days. Much planning to be done but we need people to save the date and consider joining a Venturing Crew if they want to participate.</p>
<p>We have solved the pistol issues, at least for now, and are looking forward to a terrific event this coming spring.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Upcoming Training</strong></p>

<p>Fall training has concluded. On-line training is available at <a href="http://my.scouting.org"><strong>here</strong></a>. Don't overlook hazardous weather training which is required for campouts. In person training will be scheduled in the spring, watch the calendar and newsletter for details.</p>
