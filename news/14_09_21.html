<p>It is time to start thinking about Adult recognition. Every unit has unsung heroes who are key to making things happen. It may be a parent who works in the background or a Cubmaster or Scoutmaster. The Y.E.S. award is designed to recognize their efforts. At the district level we have the District Award of merit and the Robert E. Little Award for volunteers who make an outstanding commitment at the district level. The Silver Beaver Award recognizes individuals at the council. You are a key part of this recognition process because you make the nominations. More information may be found at this address&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=awards">www.ntrail.org/awards.</a></strong> Nomination Deadlines will be here soon, don&#39;t delay.

<p>Our first big event of the year is Northern Trail to Adventure (NT2A), which takes place at Camp Wisdom. Our volunteer staff is putting together a great program, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing you there! Most activities take place on Saturday. Packs are invited to spend the night in the camp area. Archery, BB guns, Caves, Rope Bridge, Sir Dee Castle, Trading Post, Pirate Ships, Campfire, and much more. Use this event as a recruiting tool at your &ldquo;School Night for Scouting.&quot; As long as everyone is filling out all that paperwork, slip in a permission slip for NT2A. This is an excellent opportunity to showcase Cub Scouting to your new recruits. It&#39;s a come and go event, so you can spend as little or as much time as you can. Check out the pictures from last year! <a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=nt2a">More information</a></p>
