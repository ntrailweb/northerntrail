		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Stretch Goals</strong></p>

		<p>I try to work out at the gym several times a week. When I am on the treadmill or lifting weights, I often ask myself, can I go a little further than last time? Do a few more reps on the weights? I'm not always successful, but I make the effort.</p>

		<p>One of my favorite quotes is "You can do more than you think you can." It's easy to get discouraged, the hill is too steep, the trail is too long and you are too tired to go on.</p>

		<p>Scouting teaches scouts that they can climb higher, go farther, and keep going even when tired. My late father told me on more than one occasion that most people give up too easily. Many times in my life I have remembered those words and they have helped me through tough times.</p>

		<p>Challenge your scouts to stretch their goals a bit and do more than they thought they could.</p>

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>

		<p>We hope your re-charter is done, but if not, time is running out. It won't happen immediately, but if your charter drops, it's much more involved than getting it done before the deadline. There is a little grace period, but in the meantime your scouts can't advance and you cannot operate your unit.</p>

		<p>Save the hassle and get it done. Help is available.</p>

		<p>Contact the <a href="mailto:steve_bloberger@icloud.com">district commissioner</a> for assistance.</p>
