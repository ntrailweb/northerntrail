<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Volunteering</p>
<p>I just spent a week volunteering at Twilight Camp. Yes, it was a bit hot, and it took some time to prepare, but the experience of working with Cub Scouts, some of whom will go on to complete their Eagle rank, was very rewarding and reminded me again that the scouting program is worth my time.</p>
<p>Those of us who have been involved in scouting for a long time have experienced having a young person come up who does not look familiar, and they tell you that they appreciated what you had done at a scouting event. Multiply that times the ones you have not encountered, and one begins to realize that scouting really does make a difference in the lives of young people. These reinforces the reality that small things can make a difference; a word of encouragement, help with small task or sharing a bit of a life skill. That look of understanding or smile signals that you've made a difference.</p> 
<p>In the past I've had the opportunity to serve on many Eagle Boards of Review and it was very apparent that these scouts who I had watched come up through the ranks had grown in maturity and gained life skills far beyond the norm even though they represented a broad range of natural abilities. These scouts all were able to rally others to assist with their projects. In most cases they were able to solicit and obtain funding from the community. All these scouts demonstrated that they could work toward and achieve goals despite obstacles. Most importantly, having been exposed to the scouting program for several years it was clear that they had internalized the key points of the scout oath and law.</p>
<p>Scouting needs your talent and energy to help make a difference in the lives of the youth in our community, opportunities to serve abound, step up and be counted.</p>
<p>Scouting works!</p> 

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Twilight Camp</p>
