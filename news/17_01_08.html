<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouting for Food</strong> Saturday February 11, 2017</p>

<p>Scouting for food is a great opportunity to demonstrate some of the values of the scout program. Food pantries in the area depend of the scouts to help restock their shelves after the holidays. Keep in mind that we have more areas to cover than we have scouts, so without your participation, available food won&#39;t be collected. Get signed up and put it on your unit calendar. More information and area maps <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-8">here.</a> Questions to Hunter Miller <a href="mailto:hmiller002.tx@gmail.com">hmiller002.tx@gmail.com</a>.</p>
