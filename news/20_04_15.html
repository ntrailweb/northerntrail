<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently changed positions in Northern Trail District and I am, among other things, now the District's Technology Chair.  Hank Voegtle is now your District Commissioner.</p>
<p>I wanted to take an opportunity to mention a couple things many of the District Units are doing to keep Scouting relevant and viable during these trying times.  First, while everyone has some spare time (commuting is either eliminated or much simpler), I'd like all Key 3 members to review my.scouting.org and make sure your adults are trained in YPT.  When we had the big push, almost exactly 2 years ago, we knew the time would come and there would be a ton of renewals required.  Well, that time is upon us and many scouters are either lapsed or about to lapse.  Please have EVERYONE take an hour to take the YPT course online.</p>
<p>My main reason for writing you, today, is to do with keeping Scouting in the lives of our youth.  I have witnessed PLC, Troop, and Crew meetings across the District and they are being very successful (especially when we let the SPL or President run the meetings).  In addition, Virtual Camp outs are a thing.  Try to have a campfire teleconference, touch base with pre-scheduled teleconferences throughout the camp out, and then host a stop-start-continue at the end of the camp out.  Also, register with the Council for their Virtual Camp-In scheduled for April 18.  Should be fun!</p>
<p>When you host a teleconference, most of the systems are very safe if you follow their guidelines and avoid shortcuts.  We have probably all heard about "zoom-bombers" by now.  You can eliminate most of that risk by 1) NOT posting the conference link on public forums 2) DO NOT use a "personal meeting ID."  Allow Zoom to generate a random meeting ID 3) DO put everyone into the waiting room and let the host allow them into the room.  WebEx has similar features and can also be extremely effective.</p>
<p>If you are using the free Zoom, remember you have 40 minutes.  You CAN host back-to-back meetings (maybe give a bio-break in between the 2 halves).  I have noticed the meetings go a little faster but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>We do have some guidance on Boards of Review, especially Eagle BoRs via teleconference.  Please see at the bottom of this email a repeat of what was in our current newsletter.</p>
<p>GroupMe: If you have not implemented this tool, or other similar tools, already then now is the time!  It supports the 2-deep and no 1-on-1 contact to a T.  It is an excellent communication tool.</p>
<p>Finally, please read the District Newsletter for updates and guidance as we navigate through the Physical Distancing environment.  We are planning a Virtual Round Table, this coming Thursday, and we would love for everyone to attend.  Please look in this weekend's Newsletter for details.</p>

<li>The Guide to Advancement says that boards of review should be done face to face. But it does allow video conferencing when face-to-face is not practical, and Social Distancing makes face-to-face boards less practical. Bryan on Scouting (https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/03/16/how-to-conduct-a-board-of-review-through-videoconferencing/) has a good review of how to do this. These same rules can also apply to Scoutmaster conferences.</li>
<li>Circle Ten automatically approves a request to hold an Eagle BOR by video conference provided you know and follow the rules. They just need to know about it. Send the Scout's name, the unit type & # and the names & contact information for the members of the board of review to the District Advancement chair (BobFaulkner@IName.com) and he will consolidate and forward to council.</li>
<li>Other ranks do not need approval, but need to follow the rules.</li>
<li>COVID-19 is a temporary situation beyond a Scout's control, so it is possible to get an extension past age 18 to complete the Eagle requirements. These extensions are being granted at the Council level during this epidemic. To request one, sent the Scout's name, PID #, date of birth, and Unit Type & #, along with the phone # and email of the Unit Leader and a parent/guardian with a description of the circumstances that prevent completing the Eagle requirements prior to the Scout's 18th birthday TO the district advancement chair (BobFaulkner@IName.com). He will coordinate the request with Council.</li>
<li>Rank and merit badge requirements can NOT be changed. For example, if the requirement says "show", the scout must show that to the reviewer or merit badge counselor. Be as flexible as you can while still following the requirements as written. And, yes, some requirements may have to wait until after the epidemic is over.</li>
</ul></p><p>Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, how-to's (hopefully ones I know how to answer), and comments or suggestions.  Stay Safe.</p>
