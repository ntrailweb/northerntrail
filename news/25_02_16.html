<p style="font-size:1.7em; font-weight:bold;">Do You Need a Nudge?</p>
<p>Several years ago, I read a business book entitled "Nudge" by Thaler and Sunstein. Informative read and it underscored some inconvenient facts about human nature. Yes, we tend to procrastinate and worse, we tend to not get around to doing the things that we want to do and know we should do.</p>
<p>The adage "Not to decide is to decide" is useful to remember. How often have we said to ourselves, I meant to do that sooner.
The scout motto is Be Prepared. Being prepared means, among other things, taking care of important matters in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Log onto <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> and review your training history and complete any open items. Check your Youth Protection, and Position training. Everyone needs Hazardous Weather Training. Set up a time in your calendar to complete these items.</p>
<p>Roundtables are a great resource and it is easy to put this off as well, so resolve to go to Roundtable.</p>
<p>We all know we want to support scouting, both directly with our own contributions of time and treasure, but we also need to help in other ways like scheduling FOS presentations for your unit and promoting council fund raising activities like Popcorn and Adventure Card sales. These are items which we know we should do, but it’s easy to push them aside for later and later never comes.</p>
<p>Here is a little <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-size:1.2em;">🫸 NUDGE 🫸</span> to get you started. Create a plan with concrete deadlines and stick to it. Don't let these important tasks slip away. Don't put off checking out the rest of this newsletter for things you might have missed.</p>
