<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Membership</strong></p>
<p>A critical part of the scout program is membership, both new and retention. Don't neglect membership activities. Units function much better with a critical mass of youth and adult leaders. Small units are in grave risk of fading away due to lack of leadership. With new members come new parents and these parents have enthusiasm, energy, and new ideas to help your unit thrive. Finally, you owe it to future generations of scouts to make the program available. If your unit fails, then there will be youth who may not have the opportunity to benefit from the program. Don't let your unit wither, plan for the future. Our district membership chair is open and we are looking for someone to help with membership growth. Our DE Katherine McCrary (214-616-6923) is filling this position until this position can be filled. If you need help with membership, don't hesitate to contact her. </p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">It's Camp Card Season</strong></p>
<p>Our scouts will receive an ENTIRE 50% commission for cards sold until 4/29/22. Participating units can do Albertson’s/Tom Thumb store-front sales through ALL of March.</p>
<ul> 
<li>There are still a TON of spots open on Blackpug to sign-up to store-front sell – go check it out!</li>
<li>Keep issuing cards to your scouts!</li>
<li>Begin having regularly scheduled turn-ins within your unit!</li>
</ul>

<p>Want tips on selling? Don’t hesitate to reach out to your camp card chair for help!
Want to turn-in money or check out more camp cards? Contact your DE, Katherine McCrary (214-616-6923), to schedule a meet up!</p>

<p>Has your unit never been to Camporee? Trust me, you have no idea what you have been missing. Camporee's are high energy and fun. The competitions are not only fun, they are also a learning experience. Add to those scout skills with your participation.

You can also talk with other leaders about all things scouting and camping. Finally, the campfire programs are always a blast, high energy and great fun.</p>
<p>With the basketball theme look for lots of interesting skills challenges and trivia madness. 
Plenty to do including round robin patrol activities in the morning and in the afternoon open areas and competitions including open ranges, root beer run, and climbing. Saturday night campfire will feature awards for the day's activities given to top performing individuals, patrols, and troops. Order of the Arrow Call out will be available for participating troops Saturday night and we encourage all Brotherhood Eligible Order of the Arrow members to participate in the Brotherhood walk.</p><p>CPR Class will held from 1:00 to 4:00 at the TRJ dining hall conducted by Mike Reisinger.

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Scouting for Food</strong></p>
<p>The uncertainty about COVID made it difficult to formulate an advance plan for a council wide Scouting for Food drive this year. Hopefully, next year we will get back on track with this signature Scouting community service activity. However, individual units are encouraged to organize their own independent Scouting for Food activities. The local food banks are always in need of food items. Scouting for food can also be an opportunity to raise awareness of scouting in your neighborhood and help you grow your unit. Get creative and formulate a plan!</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training 2022</strong></p>
<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p> 
<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>
<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p>
