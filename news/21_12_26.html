<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training Awards</strong></p>
<p>Northern Trail is known for its excellent training.  We want you to show others that you care about the program. You and others in your unit likely qualify the Scouter's Training Award. It is just a matter of filling out the application. Please see links to apply for your Training Award.<br />

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Northern Trail Awards Banquet</strong></p>
<p>This event originally scheduled for late January, 2022 will be delayed due to some issues with the venue and some uncertainty with the COVID situation. As soon as we have a new date, an announcement will be made. Sorry for any inconvenience</p>
<p>With a little more time to get the program together we are extending nominations until the end of the year for the Y.E.S. awards. This award recognizes hard working volunteers in your units. We have an easy on-line form to make nominations. Find it here: <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/yes/">ntrail.org/yes.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>We are down to the wire, get it done.  Don't let the lack of current YPT cards trip up your re-charter, make sure everyone in your unit is current.</p>

<p>Help is available, all you have to do is ask.</p>

<p>Every unit’s charter expires on December 31. The recharter process is simpler than it has been in the past and by uploading documents and paying online, you can avoid a trip to a council office. The process even allows for the gathering of required signatures online. Let’s get started now and be 100% rechartered on January 1. For more help, contact you Unit Commissioner.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for the re-charter process you are still responsible to get your training up to date and any dues paid. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Youth Protection Training</span> is required for all adults and must be completed every two years.</p>
<p>Any questions or problems please contact your unit commissioner or Steve Bloberger who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:steve_bloberger@icloud.com">steve_bloberger@icloud.com</a></p>
