			<p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: arial;"><strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/more-why">More on Why</a></strong></p>

			<p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: arial;"><img align="left" hspace="5" src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/small_a-founders01%5B1%5D.jpg" />John Slaughter has done a fantastic job in his recent blogs in trying to describe the WHAT, the HOW and the WHY of the Boy Scout program. I especially agree with him that the WHY is perhaps the most elusive. Undoubtedly, it is the most difficult to describe, especially to the modern parents who may be ill-informed and believe that the Scouting program is simply a camping club that teaches outdoor skills such as fire building and knot tying. Neither of which is needed nor particularly useful in our modern technical society.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: arial;">Here’s my take on WHY I’m still a believer in the program. It all starts with the program founder, Lord Baden-Powell. (Several of these concepts are taken directly from the Wood Badge curricula, while others are my own extrapolation from reading the writings of BP and observing the workings of the program.)</p>
			
			<p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: arial;">According to Robert Baden-Powell, the son of Lord Baden-Powell-the founder, his father’s vision of the program changed dramatically after attending the initial world Jamboree. His vision went from simple outdoor training for future British soldiers to a global vision of world peace. Yes, WORLD PEACE! (I certainly had no inkling or intention of this when I signed up. I just wanted to go camping with my sons!) After seeing boys from across the world of every race, religion, color and language working together, playing together and talking together, BP, as he was called, concluded that if all Scouts could be taught to understand and live by the same set of values they could not possibly go to war to fight and kill each other. This was apparently heavy on his mind, having had a lifelong military career and having lived through the horrors of war.</p>
