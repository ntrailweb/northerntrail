<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>To do my duty to God</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Your family and religious leaders teach you about God and the ways you can serve. You do your duty to God by following the wisdom of those teachings every day and by respecting and defending the rights of others to practice their own beliefs.</span> Scouting reinforces this basic value.</p>
