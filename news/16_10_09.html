<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong></p>

<p>This is the time of the year we think about who in Northern Trail should be recognized for their scouting efforts; this can be at the unit and/or district and council level.</p>

<p>At the unit level we have the Y.E.S.-Your Extraordinary Service Award, each unit can nominate 2 adults and 1 more for every additional 50 youth in the unit. Adults activity at district level- OA and District Committee can be nominated as well. The unit determines who receives the award.</p>

<p>The District Award of Merit is a council award presented by the district at their annual dinner. This person could have chaired one event or/and been involved in many scouting activities. A district committee selects the awardees from the nominations.</p>

<p>The Robert E. Little Award is a district award for long service to scouting. The district selects one person each year.</p>

<p>Additional information along with nomination forms for these three awards are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0</a> Additional supporting information can be included for the District Award of Merit and Robert E. Little awards. The deadline for each of these is Dec 1, 2016</p>

<p>The Silver Beaver is a the highest council award for scouters. The district gathers the nominations and forwards them to council. These scouters have made significant contributions to the scouting movement over a number of years. Additional information and forms are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award">northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award</a> Additional supporting information can be added. The deadline is Nov 1, 2016.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Re-Charter Time is Coming</strong></p>

<p>It is time to re-charter your unit. Every adult must have a current Youth Protection card. Either the on-line version or the face-to-face version. Face-to-face is required for some activities like Twilight Camp and Summer Camp. Leaders must have specific training for their position. Avoid the rush, start working re-charter now! <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist">Re-charter Checklist</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>The Popcorn Game Is On! </strong></p>

<p>The deadline for turning in completed sales forms this year is Friday, October 14. Your Scout can earn up to 28% of his total popcorn sales revenue, money which can be used to fund his Scouting activities throughout the year. With a brand new product from CAMP MASTERS and the chance to win great prizes, excitement about popcorn sales is hopefully running high within your unit. For more information about our new popcorn vendor, visit <a href="http://www.campmasters.org">www.campmasters.org</a>.</p>
