<p>We are saddened to report the passing of Doc Linn last Sunday morning due to cancer. Doc was an active scout, scouter and scoutmaster for more than 60 years. There will be a service on August 8th at 10am under a tent in Cottonwood Park in Richardson. Be sure and wear a face mask for this event.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">COVID-19</span></p>
<p>It's a dynamic situation and we are still learning, but units can still meet. It is vital that everyone follow the procedures and minimize the risks to all participants. Get the latest information before planning any event, be proactive and work within the guidelines. We can realize the benefits of scouting while keeping everyone safe. Here are some resources:<ul>

<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Training</span></p>
<p>We know that many of you have been putting this off, but now is the time to act and get the required training. Lack of a current youth protection card is a showstopper, and this need not be the case. Allocate some time in front of your computer and "get er done."</p> 

<p>To take the course visit <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org</a>. Many Northern Trail unit Scoutmasters, Cubmasters and Den leaders are not position trained. Training is required for these positions and will make your job as a leader easier. In addition, be sure and take advantage of the wealth of other training resources. Hazardous Weather Training, Safety afloat. Merit Badge counselor and troop committee training. <a href="https://my.scouting.org/Documents/PositionTrainedCourses.pdf">Here</a> is a chart which explains the training requirements for each scouting position. </p>

<p>There are still plenty of spots available for the "at Camp experience" at Camp Wisdom and Camp James Ray.

Council Annual Recognition Event</a></span></p>
<p>By now you may have seen that the in-person banquet will be replaced with an online event. We appreciate your patience dealing with all the date changes and now the reformatting of the event. 2020 has certainly given us an abundance of opportunity to learn to handle change!</p>
<p>If you are registered for the banquet, you will automatically receive the link that will allow you to view the event. While we will miss seeing everyone in person, we are excited about many of the changes and know you will enjoy our recognition event. We canâ€™t wait to show it! There will also be a downloadable Recognition Program for you to read and to keep. You may also guide other Scouters and family members to the link which will be published on the Circle Ten IHub and Face Book page. Now, all who wish to see the recognition event may do so without registering!</p>
<p>On August 1st, your registration fee for the banquet will be refunded through Black Pug. Many of you may wish to decline your refund and allow Circle Ten to use it towards defraying the remaining recognition event costs. Please contact Michael Prachar a Michael.prachar@scouting.org prior to August 1st if you wish to decline your refund. All others will automatically receive their refund after August 1st.</p>
<p>We will still honor our 2019 Linus D. Wright Class of Eagles even though they will not be able to attend the council recognition banquet as they have in the past. This will require each 2019 Eagle Scout to reregister through Black Pug to order their congratulatory letter, commemorative CSP, and a pin that is new this year. That link will be provided to you in the near future. Due to the refunding of all fees to attend the event, we will need to charge a nominal fee for these items. We need to be able to cover their cost and the cost of mailing them out to hundreds of Eagle Scouts. Normally, these items would only be available to those in attendance, but we will now make them available to all 2019 Eagle Scouts! We will publish that link and you will receive it in an email very soon. Also be looking for it on the Circle Ten Council Face Book page and the IHub. You may contact Leigh Anne LeBlanc, the council banquet chair, at <a href="mailto:leighcat3@gmail.com">leighcat3@gmail.com</a> if you have questions.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
