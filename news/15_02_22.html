<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/re-charter-checklist">Don't Let your Unit Charter Drop</a></strong></p>

<p><img style="float:left; margin:5px;" src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/paper_work.png"> For some units in Northern Trail, the end of February could mean the loss of their unit charter.  If you are the unit chairman or the unit leader, it is your responsibility to insure that paperwork is completed and submitted to the council office.  If your unit charter drops, then the contract your chartering organization has with the Boy Scouts of America will come to an end and none of your adults or scouts will be part of the program.  This means no &nbsp;<strong><i>insurance, no advancement, no access to camps and no training.</i></strong>  The process of creating a unit from scratch is much more difficult than a simple renewal!</p><p>This can be avoided by completing the paperwork and turning it into the council office.</p>
<p>You are not <strong>alone!</strong> Help is available. Your unit commissioner is available to assist you by answering questions and helping you to resolve problems.</p><p>Every adult leader must have a current YPT or Face-to-Face card to be included in the re-charter.  If your adults have a valid card, but the records are not up to date, this is easily <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/ypt-issue-re-charter">corrected.</a></strong> If not, a few minutes taking an online course will fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>Here is a <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/re-charter-checklist">checklist</a></strong> which will help you get started.</p>
