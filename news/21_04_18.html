<p>Here is a link to a podcast made about an encounter with a newly minted Eagle Scout. <a href="https://simplyinspiration.me/2021/04/13/94-i-have-no-memory/">https://simplyinspiration.me/2021/04/13/94-i-have-no-memory/</a></p>

<p>Twilight camp is a week-long late afternoon, early evening event for Cub Scouts. The theme for Twilight Camp this year is "Weird Science." Lots of fun activities are planned in a COVID safe environment. This event will be held, as in the past, at Breckinridge Park in Northeast Richardson. BB guns, archery, crafts, games, egg drop, swaps and more. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NTTwilightCamp">Registration</a> now available. Check out pictures from past Twilight Camps <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/forms-and-more.html#pictures">here</a>. Another benefit is that as an adult, you will enjoy the activity and meet other parents dealing with the many of the same challenges you are facing.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Summer Camp</strong></p>
<p>Summer camp is key to the scouting experience. Circle Ten has programs this summer to fit your schedule and interests. Camps are filling fast, so claim your spot.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable Thursday May 13, 2021</strong></p>
<p>The May Roundtable will be an in-person affair held outdoors. Plans are to hold it on the field west of the First United Methodist Church on the east side of Custer Road beginning at 7:00pm.</p>
<p>Gravity, so weak you can lift a glass to get a drink, so strong you don’t fly off the earth as it spins. Our May Roundtable will be live and in person and discuss STEM in Scouting along with the Nova and Supernova awards. The meeting will close by celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Alan Shepard being the first America in space (May 5, 1961) by launching 2-liter soda bottle “rockets.” So bring you lawn chairs, your 2-liter soda bottles, and your kids. This will be a fun and informative Roundtable. More details coming soon.</p>

<p>National Youth Leadership Training is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home troops and in other situations demanding leadership of self and others.</p>
<p>The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO. The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT">Learn more</a>.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Friends of Scouting</strong></p>

<p>It has been a really tough year for everyone. Some more so than others. All of us have suffered due to lack of social interactions with friends and colleagues. Scouting has suffered, it has been more difficult to deliver the program. Everyone is adapting, however Circle Ten has suffered financially as well. It takes money to care for our camps, offices and pay the dedicated professionals who work hard to create the environment needed to deliver the program. Many of us have stepped up and dug a little deeper to fill the gap, but we are still short of what is needed to keep the council financially healthy.</p>
<p>If you can help, please consider making a pledge or an additional pledge. You can do it <a href="https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021">online.</a>
