<p>We need to get units scheduled for presentations and we still need a few presenters.</p> 

<p>Contact our Our district executive, Chad Caudle to schedule your presentation. Chad may be reached at: 214-902-6743 | C 806-548-0575 <a href="mailto:chad.caudle@scouting.org">chad.caudle@scouting.org</a>. </p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouting for Food</strong> Saturday February 4 & 11, 2017</p>

<p>The Scouting for Food bags are now available, Pick them up on the porch at 926 Wedgewood Way in Richardson. Please take only what you expect to use! We have enough bags, but only if they are distributed properly. Last year we ran out of bags before all units got them. Informational handouts to go with the bags are also available.</p>

<p>Distribute the bags in your assigned areas on Saturday February 4th and pick them up on Saturday February 11th.</p>

<p>Scouting for food is a great opportunity to demonstrate some of the values of the scout program. Food pantries in the area depend of the scouts to help restock their shelves after the holidays. Keep in mind that we have more areas to cover than we have scouts, so without your participation, available food won&#39;t be collected. Get signed up and put it on your unit calendar. More information and area maps <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-8">here.</a> Questions to Hunter Miller <a href="mailto:hmiller002.tx@gmail.com">hmiller002.tx@gmail.com</a>.</p>
