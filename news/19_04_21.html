<p><img style="max-width:30%;" hspace="5" align="right" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/tc_2019_patch_150.png"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Twilight Camp is only 6 weeks away</span> and we have lots of spots still open! That’s right, <span style="font-weight:bold;">you can and should still register!</span> Regular registration ends on <strong>April 29th!</strong> In the past you have been able to sign up for camp before the deadline to save your spots and pay after Camp Card sales ended. This year, with the change in the registration system that option is not available and the full fee must be paid by April 29 to avoid paying the late fee.</p><p>Next, the new system has other issues related to the one discussed above:</p><p>First, you can create an account or continue as a “Guest.” In the interest of time, continue as a guest on the system.  Most of our registrants have signed up as guests.</p><p>Second, when a registration is made, the new system will not save your registrations without some payment being made. To avoid this, please try to make a full payment. If you or your unit is unable to make a full payment, please make a partial payment ($5.00, for example) and pay the balance later-but remember that the full fee must be made by April 29 to avoid the late fee.</p><p>Finally, Twilight Camp needs staff, especially for program areas. To assist with staffing twilight camp please contact, Tom Crain at 469-261-3803 or <a href="mailto:cubmaster@pack890.com">cubmaster@pack890.com</a> or Hank Voegtle at 214-769-5040 or <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com">hjv3@outlook.com</a>.</p><p>Register campers or staff at the following <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-NTtwilightcamp">https://scoutingevent.com/571-NTtwilightcamp</a>.<br />
