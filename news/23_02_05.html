<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Camporee is Coming</strong> </p>

<p>Every year Northern Trail hosts a Camporee at one of the Circle Ten Scout camps. This year camporee will be held at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp near Athens Texas the weekend of <nobr><strong>April 14-16, 2023</nobr></strong>. This year the district will be teaming with a few other districts and this will make for an even better and bigger camporee than in years past.</p>
	<p>What is camporee? Camporee is an opportunity to demonstrate scout skills, observe and visit with other units and see how they manage their campouts. The event is capped off with a camp fire program with all of the units present. Usually there are skits and other entertainment. The evening program will usually conclude with an Order of the Arrow call out ceremony. 
	</p>
	<p>Expect comfortable temperatures, but there is always the chance for a little rain, but this rarely dampens the activities very much.</p>
	<p>If your unit has not participated in a camporee recently, now is the time to change that and plan on attending this year. Expect a great time and a memorable experience for your scouts.<a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022TRJSpringCamporee2">More information and unit registration.</a> </p>
