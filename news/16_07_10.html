<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Making it Happen</strong></p>

<p>Many of you participated in both unit events and district events during the year.  Events like campouts, Blue and  Gold Banquets,  Pinewood Derbies, Northern Trail to Adventure, Webelos Woods, Camporee and Twilight Camp are examples.  You may have wondered  how itâ€™s possible to put on a big scouting event. It just seems overwhelming.   Because it seems overwhelming some adults are afraid to step forward and volunteer. </p>

<p>The people who do step forward, have no more spare time or ability than you have!   The essential ingredient is a willingness to help.</p>

<p>Making an event happen with a great result is actually not as difficult as you might think, it just takes a little preparation!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>So how to get started?</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 1:</span> Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel. These events have been done before, many times! Ask the old hands, many of whom can be found in the ranks of the commissioner&rsquo;s staff. Identify what worked well and what did not. Learn from the mistakes of those who have gone before you. You can&rsquo;t possibly anticipate every problem, but find out what tripped up folks in the past and conversely, implement the winning ideas.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 2:</span> Start early! Waiting until the last minute to start planning your event will make your job that much harder. Even if you don&rsquo;t have every detail, you can start making a list and include the items which can&rsquo;t be cast in stone immediately.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 3:</span> Build a team.  Too many adults are afraid to ask for help or they make halfhearted public appeals for help.   Trying to do everything yourself is a recipe for frustration and burnout!  The key to building a team is twofold; First, identify the candidates who fit the roles you are trying to fill.  Secondly, buttonhole the candidates one at a time and "sell" them on participating.   It's fun,  not that difficult, rewarding and it won't happen unless volunteers are found.   If they can't or won't help, ask them to suggest someone else and help recruit that person.  Don't take no for an answer.  From personal experience, I can tell you that asking more than once pays off!  Don't wait too long to ask, folks are busy and their schedules fill up fast!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 4:</span> Schedule meetings, but prepare for the meetings. An agenda should be in the hands of every participant prior to the meeting. Come ready to identify and assign tasks.   Don't call unnecessary meetings, many details can be worked out via email. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 5:</span> Keep your meetings short and on track.  Address the agenda items, get commitments from your team members and schedule completion of each item. Track the progress of each item.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 6:</span> Identify items which have the potential of going wrong. What will you do if it rains, for example. Have a plan B and C!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 6:</span> Divide and conquer; with an early start and a great team, you can not only allocate tasks to team members, they and you will have enough time to get everything done without major heartburn.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 7:</span> Promote your event,</span> sell it as a great opportunity and get the word out in time to get on people&#39;s calendars. Wait too long and the time will get filled with something else!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Step 8:</span> Watch a great event come together with lots of happy smiling scouts and adults!</p>

<p>If you have been involved in scouts for a while and particularly if your Scout has moved on, commissioner service is a great way to keep up with scouting, continue to provide a valuable service, and make a difference. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioner-service"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Continue reading</span></a></p>
