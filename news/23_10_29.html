<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Adult Scouter Recognition</p>
<p>Scouting only exists due to the dedication of volunteers. They give their time and talent without compensation. Even though volunteers are not paid, the value of their contributions are invaluable.</p>
<p>In the work world, hard work and talent is compensated. Sometimes this includes public recognition.</p>
<p>Volunteers are not all the same, but most of them like to be appreciated for their efforts. How can we show appreciation? We can do this in several ways, first make sure the volunteer knows that you appreciate their efforts by telling them directly. It’s also important to be respectful of their time. None of us would intentionally waste the time of someone we were paying to perform a task. Make sure that volunteers have the resources they need to complete a task. This may be as simple as clear instructions for an assigned task.</p>
<p>Volunteers may not say so, but they appreciate public recognition. In scouting we have several awards to recognize leaders in units, districts, council, and the national level. Your unit may have awards specific to your unit. At the district level have a recognition banquet to honor volunteers at the unit and district level. You can nominate someone in your unit for the <a href="http://ntrail.org/yes"><strong>Your Extraordinary Service award</strong></a>, which recognizes volunteers at the unit level. <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/district-award-merit.html"><strong>The District Award of Merit</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/robert-e-little-service-award.html"><strong>Robert E. Little Award</strong></a> recognize exceptional service by scouters at the district level. At the council level the <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/92-103.pdf"><strong>Silver Beaver Award</strong></a> recognizes scouters who have provided exceptional long-term service to scouting. 
In February of next year, we will honor these individuals at a dinner. 
Please take the time to personally recognize volunteer service and nominate individuals you know who are deserving of recognition.
</p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <strong>mzi@gatech.edu</strong>.</p>


<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership + Recruiting</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>School Night for Scouting:</strong> Fall recruiting is still in process. Northern Trail has done well so far, but we are not done yet. If you can help or need information, please contact Katherine McCrary at 	<a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org"><strong>Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</strong></a>.</li>

<li><strong>Follow up on New Members:</strong> Pack Unit Leaders, don't forget to check in with every prospective parent that signed-in on the attendance rosters from your SNFS events. A followup phone call, email or even a postcard can make the difference. Remember, you understand the value of the scout program, with new parents you must sell the program.</li>

<li><strong>Grow your Membership:</strong>
Growing your membership should be a year round activity. You should always be looking for opportunities to recruit more scouts into the program! Pack and troop leaders, if you'd like to hold a fall recruitment event for your unit, the council can assist you in promoting it. Email <a href="mailto:katherine.mccrary@scouting.org"><strong>katherine.mccrary@scouting.org</strong></a> to create and print fliers to be distributed in your community.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>Those of us who have been involved with scouting for many years know that the recharter process can be a little painful. Avoid the pain in two ways, first don't wait until the last minute. The second way to avoid headaches is to follow the <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>procedure</strong></a> and ask questions if you have any doubts. Seeming minor things like signatures will land your recharter in the "defective" pile and the problems will need to be worked.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for recharter in your unit, make sure your dues are paid and any required training is complete. An out-of-date YPT card is a non-starter! Please do your part. Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>Youth Protection Training Current?</strong></a></p>
<p>Your unit cannot complete Recharter if your YPT card is not current. Time flies, check your card and take the training if needed. Get training at: <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. Don't wait, get done now.</p>
<p>Unit leaders, check the status of the adults in your unit now online.</p> 
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>Financial Aid</strong></a>
