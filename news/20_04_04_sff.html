<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Scouting For Food</strong></p>
<p>Since the inception of scouting in America, more than 100 years ago, scouts have risen to the challenge during national emergencies. This has been demonstrated time and time again. It's what we as scouts do. A scout is helpful and kind!</p>
<p>Every year the scouts in Northern Trail collect thousands of pounds of food for Network of Community Ministries. Because of COVID-19 it is not possible at this time for the scouts to canvass the neighborhoods for food donations. Due to the pandemic, the number of clients the food bank is servicing has expanded greatly. There are many who have never needed help before who cannot feed their families. When there is a need scouting will find a way. <strong>Here is the plan:</strong><ul>
<li>Scouting families, when you shop, pick up items for the food bank and drop them off at the facility. When you arrive at the facility there will be someone to help you transfer the donation safely.</li>
<li>Contact others in your unit and challenge them to participate in this important effort.</li>
<li>Contact your neighbors by phone or email and encourage them to help the scouts deliver on the food drive. Explain that normally you would be scouting for food but cannot because of the pandemic and could they please buy a few extra items when they shop and drop them by the food bank.</li>
<li>When you call your neighbors ask them to spread the word to the others they know to add momentum to the drive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together we can make a difference in the lives of families who are struggling due to the impact of the pandemic. When it is safe to do so we will have the normal food drive and there is no doubt the food bank will need additional food items.</p>
