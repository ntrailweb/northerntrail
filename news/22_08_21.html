<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">School Night For Scouting</strong> </p>
<p>School nights for scouting are in full swing it is vital that your unit participates. Be sure make these new scouts and their parents feel welcome in your unit. With new scouts come new parents and new parents have enthusiasm, skills, and energy to help your unit thrive.</p>
<p>If you have free evenings on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday over the next 2 months and want to pitch in for recruitment.  Text our DE, Katherine McCrary, 214-616-6923 to assist with registration check-out and guide new parents at SNFS Nights. She has the schedule for you to sign-up. She would love any help we can get! Please contact Katherine McCrary <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Be Prepared</strong></p>
<p>We all know the scout motto, but do we take it to heart? Most of us have flown many times, but up in the front, a good fight crew has a little meeting prior to takeoff. The purpose of the meeting is to have a plan if things don't go well. While the likelihood of a problem is very low, they will be prepared based on the factors at hand so they will have a better chance of a good outcome. Most of us in back don't pay as close attention to the safety briefing as we should, but that's part of being prepared.</p>
<p>Life is going to throw our scouts curve balls, we want them to be prepared to act when things go wrong. From the simple case of a broken tent pole to how to deal with a medical emergency. Teach your scouts to be prepared by setting a good example and making it a priority.</p> 


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Candy Land Adventure</strong></p><img align="right" style="float:right; width:20%;" src="https://ntrail.org/documents/2022%20Cub%20Adventure%20Day%20Patch.png"">

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Popcorn Fund Raising</strong></p>
<p>The annual Popcorn sale is now in progress and if your unit has not signed up to participate, it's not too late. The popcorn sale is a vital part of the overall income to the council, and it supports not only the council, but your unit and scouts benefit as well.</p>
<p>Contact our District Popcorn Kernel, Amy Weems by phone or email for help: 817-891-0736, <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:amy.weems82@gmail.com">amy.weems82@gmail.com</a>. More information <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/30562/popcorn">here.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone.</p>
