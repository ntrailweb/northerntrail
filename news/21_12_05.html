<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">The world is more and less complex than you think.</strong></p>
<p>A common failing among young people is the belief that they know more than they really do. I'm constantly reminded of the ancient saying: "The more you know, the more you realize you don't know." At the same time, we often fall into the trap of thinking that we cannot do something, the mountain is too high, the problem is too complex, or I just don't have the energy. I have reminded scouts and others that they underestimate what they can do. "You can do more than you think you can." Very difficult challenges can be overcome even though they seem daunting or impossible in the beginning. Scouting challenges our youth by reminding them that they do not have all the answers when we allow them to fail. At the same time, we provide them the opportunity to succeed and learn that they can do more than they thought.</p>
<p>Scouting provides powerful life skills training.</p> 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Time is running out. If you are responsible for re-charter in your unit, help is available, just ask. The longer you wait the more involved the process becomes.  No one wants to scramble at the last minute.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for the re-charter process you are responsible to get your training up to date and any dues paid. Youth Protection Training is required for all adults and must be completed every two years.</p>
<p>Any questions or problems please contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>There is 1 remaining recharter clinics available, all at FUMC-Richardson all starting at 7:00 pm. on December 9</span>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Membership</strong> </p>
