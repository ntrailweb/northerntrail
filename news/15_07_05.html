<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Obey the Scout Law</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">The twelve points of the Scout Law are guidelines that can lead you toward wise choices. When you obey the Scout Law, other people will respect you for the way you live, and you will respect yourself.</span><br />Scouting reinforces these basic values.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Tau Day and Venturing News</strong></p>

<p>The Northern Trail Tau Day celebration was a good time had by all. Plenty of pies to go around and a vibrant discussion about Venturing in Northern Trail and Circle Ten.</p>

<p>Northern Trail Venturing Forum will be taking off in July and we will be restarting up in August in time to support our units' Program Planning.</p>

<p>With the new Program Year coming up, the Venturing Forum would like to ask to the Venturing Units to send me, Joe Tavares (<a href="mailto:havforum@gmail.com">havforum@gmail.com</a>), a brief email with the Committee Chair, Unit Leader and current President's names and contact information. Also, what would these leaders like to see in the 2015-2016 Venturing Forum meetings which they would consider valuable.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Training Makes a Huge Difference</strong></p>
<p>Is your unit struggling? Not getting the results you want? The key is training, strive to get every parent in your unit trained this fall. It will benefit your unit in several ways. Some of these parents will become more active in your unit and the rest will understand the program and be able to help their child progress and they will be more supportive of you. Details on upcoming training will be posted soon, start working now to sell the parents of your scouts on training!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/roundtables">No Roundtables or Staff Meetings in July</a></strong></p>
