<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Duty to my country</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Help keep the United States a strong and fair nation by learning about our system of government and your responsibilities as a citizen and future voter.<br />
America is made up of countless families and communities. When you work to improve your community and your home, you are serving your country. Natural resources are another important part of America's heritage worthy of your efforts to understand, protect, and use wisely. What you do can make a real difference.</span> Scouting reinforces this basic value.</p>
