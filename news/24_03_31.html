<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Religious Emblems </strong><p>	
<p>Two of the fundamental principles of Scouting are that a "Scout is reverent" and that a scout does his or her duty to God. One way scouts can demonstrate this by earning the religious emblem of their faith. As the last sentence implies, the requirements for these awards are administered by the scout's faith. In most faiths there are religious emblems for every level of scouts, from a brand new lion to a venturer. The emblems is typically awarded by the youth's religious body and may be worn on the scout uniform. A silver square knot on a purple background can also be worn on the uniform in place of the actual emblem. Most faiths also have an emblem for adults which, in most cases, is awarded based on a nomination.</p>
<p>As the Northern Trail District Religious Emblems Coordinator, I would welcome the opportunity to speak to your unit about the religious emblems program or to speak with your unit committee about why your unit should have a religious emblems coordinator. Please feel free to reach out to me, Hank Voegtle, to schedule a presentation or if you have any questions at 214-769-5040 or <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com"><strong>hjv3@outlook.com</strong></a>.

<p>It is not too late to make your FOS pledge for 2024. Scouting depends on the support of scouters like you to make the program thrive. We need your volunteer hours and your financial support as well.</p>
<img align="right" hspace="5" style="width:10%; float:right; margin-left:5px;" src="https://ntrail.org/clipart/c10logo.png">
<p>Without volunteers the scouting program could not function. Financial support is needed to provide the resources to you as volunteers to make scouting possible with programs, facilities, camps and professional staff.</p>
