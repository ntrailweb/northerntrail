<p>It is official, the current 2018 Online Youth Protection Training meets state requirements and has been approved by the State of Texas.</p>
<p>If you have completed the new BSA online Youth Protection Training course on or after March 13, 2018, you no longer need to take a classroom-facilitated version of the course to attend a licensed camp (camps of four or more days).</p> 
<p>If you have not taken the <strong>new</strong> BSA online Youth Protection Training course, you must do so by <strong>October 1, 2018</strong>. or you won’t be able to re-charter with your unit.</p>
<p>If you have a valid Face-to-Face card, it will be accepted for Twilight Camp and Summer Camp this year.</p>
<p>Questions can be emailed to  <a href="mailto:571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org">571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org</a>.</p>
<p>So take the time to complete this course and get it out of the way for the fall.  While you are at it, take the Hazardous Weather Training.

<p style="font-size:18px;"><img align="right" hspace="5" src="http://ntrail.org/pictures/Radio-Scouting.png"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable</strong> Tuesday, May 8th 7:00PM</p>
<p>Our May 8th Boy Scout Roundtable subject is Radio Merit Badge and Jamboree on the Air.  The 2017 devastating storms in the Caribbean Islands left people in the remote areas without communications. Ham radio operators were placed in these areas.  They became the only source of information about the people who did or did not survived as well as being the only connection for emergency help.  Find out more about the purpose of Ham Radio and how interested Scouts and Scouters can learn more about becoming an amateur radio operator.  Our guest speaker will be from Plano Amateur Radio Klub. We are expecting an informative and entertaining presentation. Please join us. First United Methodist Church, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vYSKTy2LfyR2">Map</a> Education Building <a href="http://www.fumcr.com/campus_floor-plans">Room 230</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Roundtable</strong> Tuesday, May 10th 7:00PM</p>

<p>What is Roundtable? Roundtable is a form of commissioner service and supplemental training for volunteers at the unit level. The objectives of roundtables are to provide leaders with program ideas; information on policy and events; and training opportunities. It is a forum for sharing experiences and enjoying fun and fellowship with other Scout leaders. When skillfully executed, the roundtable experience will inspire, motivate, and enable unit leaders to provide a stronger program for their Scouts.</p>
<p>Recruiting should be a year round activity. We will focus on different methods of recruiting for both youth and adults, help set up a plan for recruiting and how do we measure our recruiting activities. All this and more will be discussed at Cub Scout Round table on Thursday, May 10th at 7 p.m. in Room 227 at the First United Methodist Church of Richardson, 2nd floor of the Education building, <a href="http://www.fumcr.com/campus_floor-plans">Campus Map</a>  503 N.

<p><img align="left" hspace="5" src="http://www.arapahochapter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Arapaho_Alternate_Logo-COLOR_SMALL.png">It's sort of become a tradition that we always hold a cookout at the end of the school year. This year, we will keep with that tradition, since we will go on hiatus over the summer and not meet again until the beginning of the next school year. We will serve hamburgers and hot dogs at the meeting, which will be free to all Arapaho Chapter members, who are current on their OA lodge dues. If you have not renewed your dues for 2018, you may do so at the lodge website <a href="http://www.miki.org/events/2018-lodge-dues/">here.</a> We hope to see you all at the meeting in Heights Park. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xKrtvRxJXiH2">Map</a></p>

<p><strong>Finish Strong!</strong> We are coming to the end of the 2018 <strong>Friends of Scouting</strong> Fund Raising Campaign.  Through the hard work of many volunteers we are doing well, but we have more to do.  Friends of Scouting is a Council wide fund drive which contributes more than 30% of Circle Ten's budget.  You can give a check made out to Circle Ten Council to your unit Chairman or Leader and they will pass it on to Council. Alternatively you can contribute online at <a href="http://circleten.org/give-now">http://circleten.org/give-now</a> - Just make sure to include in the note field "FOS, Northern Trail along  with your unit number. Northern Trail Scouters have always recognized the value of scouting by contributing to the Friends of Scouting. Any amount will help!  Let’s keep the tradition going.  A volunteer will contact you in the next few weeks if we have not heard from you.  Don't put it off any longer, if you've already made a pledge this year, <b>Thank You.</b></p>
