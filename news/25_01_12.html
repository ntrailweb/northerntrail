<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Day Of Service</p>
<p>Scouting America’s National Day of Service is Saturday, February 8. In Northern Trail we have three service project beneficiaries, the City of Richardson’s Parks Department, Network of Community Ministries, and First United Methodist Church.</p>
<p>We will be providing service to the Richardson Parks Department at Breckenridge Park and Spring Creek Nature Area and will need approximately 60 youth and adults at each location to work on litter and trash removal. Participants should bring work gloves and trash pickers or grabbers if they have them.</p>
<p>To show our district’s support for First United Methodist Church of Richardson there will be a service project of landscaping cleanout and improvements at the church’s First Center-the small house across Custer from the main campus. This project will require ten youth and adults who should come with work gloves, shovels or rakes, hand clippers, and trash bags.
Finally, everyone and every unit should be able to take part in our project benefitting Richardson’s Network of Community Ministries, generally known as Network. If you are not familiar with Network, it benefits residents of the 14 zip codes within RISD, including the parts of those zip codes that may be a part of other school districts. Network has a food pantry and a clothing closet, and we will be collecting for both. This project is suitable for all youth and adults, but we’d like you to distribute fliers on February 1 and collect food and clothing on February 8.</p>
<p>Units should planning to participate should register on the council’s website, <a href="https://247scouting.com/forms/571-2025DayofService"><strong>here</strong></a>. To insure that staffing is balanced we would also like units or individuals to sign up at <a href="https://bit.ly/3Wcv8iL"><strong>here</strong></a></p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to call me, Hank Voegtle, at (214) 769-5040 or email me at <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com"><strong>hjv3@outlook.com</strong></a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Adult Recognition</p>
<p>Entertainers will tell you that a cheering crowd, applause or even laughter provides energy and inspiration, and they perform better. Similarly, volunteers will be more energized and creative when they feel appreciated for the hard and quality work they do in our units. When their efforts appear to go unnoticed, they can become discouraged and begin to question their effectiveness and if it is worth the time and effort.</p>
<p>We all benefit from the work of volunteers and all of us have seen this on both sides, as a volunteer and someone who benefits. Without Scoutmasters, Cubmasters, den leaders, committee members and merit badge counselors to name a few, the program simply would not exist. Many of us have personal experience with leaders who inspired us, and we have all seen youth blossoming due to the efforts of outstanding volunteers.</p>
<p>Take the time to show the volunteers in the scouting movement that you appreciate not only their efforts, but the quality of their work. <strong>Tell</strong> them directly, <a href="https://ntrail.org/yes/"><strong>nominate</strong></a> them for an award and then <strong>bring</strong> them to the annual District Awards Banquet on February 19th, 2025 to celebrate their achievement. You may purchase tickets online

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Roundtable</strong></p>

<p>This coming Thursday at 7:00PM, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eRuPNpfdiCT6S262A"><strong>FUMC</strong></a> the topic will be Unit Budgets and how to keep your unit financially on track.</p>
<p>The February Roundtable will be focus on building a culture of trained leaders. Not only is training required, training makes your job easier and more effective.</p>
