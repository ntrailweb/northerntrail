<p><img align="right" vspace="10" hspace="5" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/twilight_camp_thumb_2018.png">Hurry, time is running out, get signed up today for Twilight Camp! Go to the Northern Trail District Website and <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-june-4-8-2018">signup today.</a> Waiting until the last minute makes it hard on everyone and we'd like to focus on the program, not last minute paperwork!</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em">Walking Den Leaders Needed</p>
<p>Twilight Camp is only possible due to the generous support of volunteers. In addition to the volunteer staff, adults are needed to function as "Walking Den Leaders." Walking Den Leaders walk with their group and make sure everyone gets from station to station and are alert for any problems.  Yes, grandparents can serve as Walking Den Leaders!</p>
<p>Every Tiger must have a parent or guardian present. For older scouts a minimum of 1 adult for every 5 scouts is required.</p>
<p>Right now, we are short walking den leaders, in particular for Webelos groups.  We normally split the Webelos up into 8 groups so that half go to archery while half go to BB guns.  This allows for more time shooting but requires that I have at least 2 adults for 10 boys in each group.  Right now, I have groups that do not have any adults.  If we do not get more Walking Den Leaders for the Webelos, we will not be able to split them up and allow for more shooting time.</p>
<p>Serving as a Walking Den Leader is not difficult. The cost is a mere $10 and the time commitment is from 4:00PM to 8:30PM each day. First you need to register on CampMaster.  Look for Northern Trail Twilight Camp.  We will ask you which rank you are walking with each day or if you will be absent that day.  You would choose Adult Participant as the participant’s role and then Walking Den Leader.</p>
<p>You will also need either a current Face-to-Face Youth Protection card, or if you don't have that, you can take the online version at: <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. You will also need to fill out the Adult In Camp State Compliance <a href="Adult In Camp State Compliance Form">Form</a>. The last item is the medical Medical <a href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/healthsafety/pdf/680-001_ab.pdf">form</a>. We also need a medical form for the youth.  If you have any questions, please contact Barbara Richer at <a href="mailto:barbara.richer@yahoo.com">barbara.richer@yahoo.com</a> 214-478-3972.</p>

<p><img align="left" hspace="5" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/ww_2018_small.png">Here is a great opportunity to get help up and coming Boy Scouts get a great launch into the Boy Scout program.

The theme for Webelos Woods is “Scout Skills”. Scout Troops are encouraged to volunteer for STAFF in the following areas:  Compass, First Aid (making kits),  Knife & Axe (safe use and cleaning), Dutch Oven Cooking, First Aid bandage ( using neckerchief), Tug- a-war,  String Burning, Campsite inspections, and other events TBD.

Cost for event has been set at $10.00 for Cub and Cub Adult.
Cubs and Scout Troops provide their own food.
