<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Trails End Popcorn Training</strong></p>
<p>Popcorn season is officially kicking off!!! There are lots of new features to this year’s sale so make sure your unit is in attendance. Please ensure if your unit plans to sell you’ve signed up so your packet is ready at the training. First training will be on Monday, August 5th 7pm at Lake Highlands Presbyterian Church. For additional training dates please click below<br /><a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/26060/popcorn-trainings-and-kickoffs">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/26060/popcorn-trainings-and-kickoffs</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Roundtable</strong></p>
School Night for Scouting Training<br /> 
Even if you’ve been doing school night for years, there is always room for improvement. Come learn (or get a refresher) on everything you’ll need to know for this year’s School Night season. We will discuss dates set with principals, membership fees, unit recruitment changes and much more. So join us on Thursday 7pm at FUMC Richardson</p> 

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouts BSA Roundtable</strong></p>
<p>Earning the Eagle badge involves a lot of steps and the final hurdle is the successful approval, planning and execution of the Eagle project.  The August roundtable will focus on this process and give you the tools to advise Eagle candidates in your unit.<br />
In addition, information on recruitment and School Night for Scouting will be presented.</p>

7:00 Thursday August 8, 2019, First United Methodist Church.  Education Building <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PWQ1WQVJzmshehfPA">Map</a> 

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>New Scout Year</strong></p>
<p>By Joe Tavares<br />
Northern Trail District Commissioner</p>
<p>The new Scouting year is going to be a very exciting time in Northern Trail District.  Some relatively recent developments have given us better vision into our new year:
<ul>
<li>We enter into our first full year of Scouts BSA.</li>
<li>We also get to welcome back our District Executive, Jorge Salazar, and look forward to his first full year as our DE.</li>
<li>Welcome to our new Field Director, Mike Garcia, and the leadership he will offer to Northern Trail and Jorge.</li>
<li>The District Realignment process is complete and Northern Trail District will remain the same.</li>
<li>LDS disengagement is in full swing and existing non-LDS troops should be looking to boys from the LDS troops to transfer to theirs.  Please be aware of special rules around that recruitment. <a href="https://az601583.vo.msecnd.net/app-content/posts/10616/2018/09/18/circleten_09_06_35_8479.pdf">Here</a> is an FAQ which should give you an introduction.
</li>
<li>Circle Ten delivered on the promise that Summer Camp would be a great experience for girls as well as boys.  In my communication with leaders from other Councils, ours was a clear leader in vision and execution!</li>
</ul>
Some things we will be looking for, going into the new year:
<ul>
<li>Unit Commissioners - this is, without a doubt, becoming critical.  Commissioner Service is an excellent use of your time and experience.  It's not just about Unit Visits (but that is important).  We help Units work through issues, become more successful and we are really the face of the district.  We recruit Commissioners from all walks of Scouting: Committee, the corps of Scoutmasters and ASMs, parents of Scouts who have aged out, etc.  If you believe you can offer a small amount of time to the Commissioners Staff, we can train you and help you be successful.  It is a very interesting and gratifying volunteer position and you probably have the background to be a Unit Commissioner.  The next Commissioners Staff Meeting is Tuesday, August 6 (refer to the calendar for details).  Come to the meeting and meet the team.  You CAN do it.</li>
<li>A reinvigorated Popcorn Season: Scouts BSA Troops, both boys and girls, can make money to support their programs and activities through popcorn sales.</li>
<li>A strong Adult Recognition year.  You know, this costs exactly nothing to nominate Adult Volunteers for recognition.  Two people from every unit in the District can receive the Your Extraordinary Service <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/yes-your-extraordinary-service-award">(Y.E.S.) award.</a>  The Units control and decide upon who receives this award from their units.  So easy and it genuinely gives you the opportunity to recognize and encourage your volunteers.  So simple.  Also, we have the <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/district-award-merit">District Award of Merit</a> and the <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-103_WB.pdf">Silver Beaver</a> and a host of other adult awards which start with your nominations.  If you don't nominate the leaders you care about, no one else will.  Start nominating your deserving people NOW.  The information on how is on the Northern Trail District web site or you can ask any of the District Leadership or your Unit Commissioner about the process to nominate.  We can totally help.</li>
<li>Training.  As you know, training changed a lot over the last year.  In order to wear the Trained patch, every Adult Volunteer needs to take the training for their position.  It's just not that hard and you may be enlightened!  You've heard it before: Every scout deserves a trained leader.   <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">https://my.scouting.org/</a> is the place to start to make sure you are trained.  Scoutbook can also show you where you are with training.</li>
<li>Advancement.  Internet Advancement 2.0 is in full swing.  I'd propose we review IA2 in the Round Table scheduled for the fall quarter.</li></ul>
