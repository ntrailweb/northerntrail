<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Association with Adults</strong></p>
<p>One of the methods of scouting which is often overlooked is the association with adults. Adults are role models and scouts pay attention to how the adults around them conduct themselves. A scoutmaster or other adult leader is in a position not only to listen and offer encouragement, but function as a mentor.</p>
<p>Association with adults is not just the scoutmaster or crew advisor. It includes other adult leaders who are in the program. Assistant scout masters, merit badge counselors and other active parents. In truth scouts with parents who are active as volunteers get more out of the program and stay in the program. Rarely have I attended an eagle board of review where the scout parents were not involved in the program in some capacity. Your association with other adults in the program will help you be a better parent.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Silver Beavers and 2016 Eagles</strong></p>
<p>Several Northern Trail scouters attended the Circle Ten Awards banquet last Thursday evening. Two scouters were recognized which many of us were there to see. Joe Tavares our current District Commissioner and Kip Lankenau who was very active in Northern Trail a few years ago. He was reorganized into the Blackland Prairie district. Congratulations to them both! The council also recognized scouts who earned their Eagle rank during 2016.</p>

<p>Scouts should take advantage of this great opportunity to
earn their age appropriate religious emblems by
participating on this workshop. Typically the younger
Scouts can earn their emblems in one two-hour
workshop while the older Scouts can fulfill the vast
majority of the requirements in this one session. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/jewish_religious_emblems_workshop-20170423.pdf">More information</a></p>

<p>Parent-N-Pal is an action-packed weekend camping experience for a Cub Scout and his parent/partner. This is a weekend of camping at a real Scout camp, doing fun activities like shooting sports such as BB guns and archery, games, horseback riding, and more! It is the perfect outdoor experience for all Cub Scouts. Sign up and come join the FUN for the weekend. All meals and program are provided for you. Please bring your own tents, sleeping bag, personal gear and camp chairs! Check out

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Tour Permits No Longer Required</strong></p>
<p>For many of us getting tour permit filed in time for an activity presented a bit of a challenge. Effective immediately these are no longer required.</p>
<p>This does change the need to carefully plan your activity and comply with all policies and procedures. Instead of focusing on forms the idea is to focus on the actual planning of the activity.</p>
