<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Citizenship</strong> </p>
<p>We have an election coming soon and this is an opportunity to reinforce one of the AIMS of scouting. You can do this by discussing the issues with your scouts, the pros and cons of each proposal and the merits of each candidate’s qualifications for public office. Finally, you can take your scout to the polling place and show how the process of voting is done from obtaining a ballot from the poll worker and then casting your vote. Leaders, explain to your scouts that part of being a good citizen means understanding the issues and voting in elections. Encourage your scouts to talk to their parents about the upcoming election.</p> 

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>The re-charter process is now underway and you can begin the process. Every unit must complete the re-charter process at this time each year. </p>
<p>There are 3 scheduled recharter clinics set, all at FUMC-Richardson all starting at 7:00 pm. The dates are November 11, November 30, and December 9.</p>
<p>If you need additionl help, please contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>Every year many units must scramble at the last minute to complete this important task. This makes it hard on everyone involved in process, please get started today. If you are not directly involved in the re-charter, you still need to get your dues paid and complete youth protection training if you have an expiring YPT card.</p>
