<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Brand New Year</strong></p>
<p>It's the start of a new decade in scouting and the times they are a changing! Scouting exists because many volunteers freely give of their time, talent and treasure to make it happen. To all those volunteers who work so hard, THANK YOU!</p>
<p>As many of you are aware the council is transitioning to a new communications tool called IHUB. In the future we will be using this tool to communicate with you about Northern Trail activities. For this to work you must be on the hub. If you are not on the hub, please join today as we transition to this new platform. Yes, it is different, but is has features which we don't currently have today. Go to <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/">https://circleten.ihubapp.org</a> and click the register link in the upper right-hand corner. You can then sign up for channels. Northern Trail is in the process of transitioning and soon we will have a channel. Our existing website will be phased out once the transition is complete.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you like and don't like about what we have been doing with the website and newsletter. We are particularly interested in what you think works well and what does not work. In addition are there other things that we should be doing? Your input will help us complete this transition in a way which will be more effective. So shoot me an email and educate me! <a href="mailto:webmaster@ntrail.org">webmaster@ntrail.org</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-recharter-time">Re-charter Time</a></strong></p>

<p>If you have NOT completed your unit re-charter, your unit is now officially "inactive." Don't despair, help is available to get it done. If your unit leaders have been begging you to complete your Youth Protection training or turn in some paperwork, please take the time to get it done today. As time goes on, the process only becomes more difficult. Meanwhile your scouts can't advance and can't make use of Circle Ten camps and facilities. Contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a>. More information may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-recharter-time">here.</a></p>
