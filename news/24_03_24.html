<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Passing of Robert Squyres</strong><p>	
<p>Long-time Northern Trail Scouter, Robert Squyres passed away this week at the age of 89. Robert was a force. Robert received the District Award of Merit and the Robert E Little Award from Northern Trail, and the Venturing Leadership Award and the Silver Beaver from Circle Ten Council District.</p>
<p>He was a great advocate of Venturing and was the driving force behind many high adventure activities inside and outside Scouting. As a leader for Troop 890 and Crew 890, his contributions were unparalleled. Robert was the Advisor for Crew 890 when that crew started Venturing Rendezvous as a unit program. He then oversaw Rendezvous moving to Northern Trail District and then, coinciding with his tenure as VOA Advisor, to Circle Ten Council where it was promoted to 2 events a year: The Gathering and Venturing Rendezvous. Through this one program he touched thousands of youths throughout the region/territory where Circle Ten resides. We have not even scratched the surface in describing the positive impact Robert had on so many youths over the years.</p>
<p>In the latter part of his scouting career, Robert mentored most of the Northern Trail leaders involved in Venturing and in High Adventure. You could always count on Robert setting up and demonstrating the "model" campsite at Northern Trail's biannual Backcountry Advanced Training program at Camp Meisenbach. While Robert was a "true" backpacker and hiker, spending most of his time taking crews to so many wilderness locations.</p>
<p>As of this writing we don't have any details on arrangements, but his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/robert.squyres"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> page will likely have more information added as it become available.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Religious Emblems</p>
<p>Two of the fundamental principles of Scouting are that a "Scout is reverent" and that a scout does his or her duty to God. One way scouts can demonstrate this by earning the religious emblem of their faith. As the last sentence implies, the requirements for these awards are administered by the scout’s faith. In most faiths there are religious emblems for every level of scouts, from a brand new lion to a venturer. The emblems is typically awarded by the youth’s religious body and may be worn on the scout uniform. A silver square knot on a purple background can also be worn on the uniform in place of the actual emblem. Most faiths also have an emblem for adults which, in most cases, is awarded based on a nomination.</p>
<p>As the Northern Trail District Religious Emblems Coordinator, I would welcome the opportunity to speak to your unit about the religious emblems program or to speak with your unit committee about why your unit should have a religious emblems coordinator. Please feel free to reach out to me, Hank Voegtle, to schedule a presentation or if you have any questions at 214-769-5040 or <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com"><strong>hjv3@outlook.com</strong></a>.</p>
