<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Venturing Forum</strong></p>

<p>Topic: Crew/Troop Partnership and Dynamics. Tuesday December 13, 7:00PM, FUMC RM213.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;To keep myself physically strong&rdquo; is the oath we take, and the role model we display to our boys. It is also a necessity for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking and high adventures. As &ldquo;Resolution Day&rdquo; approaches, we begin to set goals for ourselves for next year. Often times, these goals include getting into better physical condition. <u>Join us on Tuesday evening, December 13th, 7:00PM at our Roundtable discussion, lead by veteran High Adventurer Richard Hutchins, on being prepared for outdoor activities.</u> Please bring your stories of how you and your troop get ready for hikes, canoe trips and other activities. One thing we can share with each other is our favorite places to do warm-up hikes and shakedowns.</p>

<p>We meet at the First United Methodist Church Richardson, 503 N. Central Expressway, Education Building - Room 212</p>

<p>Attendees will receive while supply last: Cabela&rsquo;s Outdoor Outfitters discount coupons. Poor Richard&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; free entr&eacute;e cards. Free bowling at Plano Super Bowl.</p>

<p>Door Prize: A Gift Certificate to Kenny&rsquo;s Restaurants.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Advancement Modifications</strong></p>

<p>Attention all Cub Scout Leaders and Parents: a simple modification to the Cub Scout Advancement Program allows many more Scouts to reach rank requirements in todays very busy family environment. The changes are effective immediately and give Den Leaders much more flexibility in planning a successful year for their Cub Scouts. More information: <a href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/cubscouts/pdf/CubScout_Advancement_Modifications.pdf">here</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Winter Camp</strong> December 27 - 31, 2016</p>

<p>It&#39;s time for all Scouts to start signing up for the greatest event known to man. We have one of the best camps put together for you and your Scouts. We have a truly outstanding staff assembled to assure that you have one of the best times at camp you have ever had. Your staff will be leading three reenactment areas: Mountain Man, Indian Village and Lumber Jack. There are four event areas Woodturning, Climbing Tower, Shooting Sports and Welding. <a href="http://circleten.org/winter-camp">Read more.</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouting for Food</strong></p>

<p>Scouting for food is a great opportunity to demonstrate some of the values of the scout program. Food pantries in the area depend of the scouts to help restock their shelves after the holidays. Keep in mind that we have more areas to cover than we have scouts, so without your participation, available food won&#39;t be collected. More information and area maps <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-8">here.</a> Questions to Hunter Miller <a href="mailto:hmiller002.tx@gmail.com">hmiller002.tx@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friends of Scouting &ndash; &ldquo;Unit Level&rdquo; Presenters Needed</strong></p>

<p>Many of the families in attendance at the various Courts of Honor &amp; Blue and Gold FOS presentations do not know anyone else involved in Scouting outside of their unit. Having a FOS unit level presenter provides someone that has instant familiarity and credibility within that unit. So, when they see you, they see someone representing both your unit, your district, and the council. Please present this opportunity at your next Committee meeting and provide the name/contact info of those interested to Brad Newberry. He will make sure you have a fully trained, friendly, recognizable face at your next Court of Honor or Blue and Gold FOS Presentation! Email <a href="mailto:b.newberry@uslloyds.com">b.newberry@uslloyds.com</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Unit Inventory</strong></p>

<p>For those who have sent in their rosters, thank you. The rest of you know who you are. Please help out our new DE as he works hard. He will be calling you soon! Please just send a simple list of scouts in your unit to: Chad Caudle at <a href="mailto:Chad.caudle@scouting.org">Chad.caudle@scouting.org</a> as soon as possible. Chad will check them against the official records and let the units know if there are any discrepancies. Scouts not properly registered can&#39;t advance. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-inventory">More information</a></p>
