<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Obedient</strong></p>
<p>From the Scout Handbook - "Obedient. Follow the rules of your family, school, and pack. Obey the laws of your community and country." It can be difficult for children to understand why we have rules, but agreed upon rules, make our families and communities function. Leaders, encourage your scouts to be <span style="font-weight:bold;">Obedient</span>.</p>

<p>As we are going into summer. Rachel Joslyn, our Senior District Executive would like to meet with all units in Northern Trail to discuss membership and learn a little bit more about their programs! She wants to meet with every unit by middle of July, whether it be over Zoom, somewhere in Richardson or out at whatever camp your unit is attending!</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Summer Camp</strong></p>
<p><img align="left" hspace="5" style="max-width:30%; float:left; margin:5px;" src="https://ntrail.org/images/tent.avif"></p>Summer camp is the experience of a lifetime. Young people only have a few years to experience summer camp and the memories and skills will last a lifetime. I don't remember a lot about those years, however, decades later I remember summer camp clearly.

<p>Circle Ten has programs this summer to fit your schedule and interests. Camps are filling fast, so claim your spot.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/80636/maverick-camp">Maverick</a> program has been expanded, so if you cannot go with your troop, you can still attend camp.
