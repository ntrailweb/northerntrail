<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable/Venturing Forum</strong>   Tuesday, November 14, 2017, 7:00PM FUMC</strong></p>
<p>Lights - Action - Camera - Roll Tape!  It's all about video production this month at your Boy Scout Roundtable.  Everyone is invited whether you are in Cubs, Boys, Venturing, S.T.E.M., Sea Scouts, or Explorers.  There will be viable information we can all use to teach our boys and girls video production and for Scouters to use video to help recruit new members.  Your take away will be basic knowledge of how to produce a video on equipment you probably already have.</p>
<p>Our presenters are Hank Voegtle, director of our Video Contest, and Lloyd Watson, retired producer for ABC Television documentaries and ABC Sports.  He has great knowledge and great stories to share and will give us pointers for doing our very own (hopefully award-winning) videos using our smartphone cameras and basic video editing programs.
