<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable</strong></p>

<p>Northern Trail’s next virtual online Roundtable will be on Thursday, September 9 at 7:30 P.M. The subject will be STEM in Scouting, with breakouts for Cub Scouts, ScoutsBSA, and Venturing. Make plans to join us and invite two adults, leaders or parents, from your unit to join in. <a style="font-weight:bold;" style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/NT-Roundtable%209-10-20.pdf">Agenda</a> and login information. </p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter</strong></p>
<p>Re-charter login codes should now be available. Unit chairs should have received a letter. If not, your unit commissioner can assist. Beginning around October 1st units will be able to log in and begin Re-chartering. The sooner your unit starts, the sooner it will be finished. Circle Ten would like to see re-charter completed by December 4th. That means everything will be set to go for 2021 with no break. Don't panic, if you need help, contact your <a style="font-weight:bold;" style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> or Hank Voegtle <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a> Here is a handy <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist.html">checklist</a> to help you <i>get-er-done</i></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Full Stop!</strong></p>
<p>About two years ago, most of us took the new version of Youth Protection Training. This means that for most scouters in Northern Trail, their certifications have or will expire soon. You cannot participate in any scouting activity of any type without a valid card. Your unit re-charter cannot be completed until every member has a current card. Avoid the rush, get it done today. I have my updated card!</p>
<p>YPT is designed to protect not only our scouts, but adult volunteers. It's vital that everyone understand the critical concepts and procedures which keep everyone safe. Just because someone might not be interacting in person, does not change the <span style="font-weight:bold;">requirement</span> that all adults have a <span style="font-weight:bold;">valid current YPT card</span>. Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> to take the training. Only takes about an hour.</p>

<strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Recruiting New Scouts</strong></p>

<p>The Power of Three. Rallies and in school recruiting is great, but what gets a child interested in Scouting? Their friends. If each youth in a unit invites three of their friends to join Scouting, we can have exceptional growth. This year Circle Ten will recognize the unit with the top growth in each district between September 1 and October 31 with a pizza and ice cream party. To sign up, and units must sign up, send an email to Ken.Camp@scouting.org. Put “the Power of 3,” in the reference line and provide the unit number and type, the district (Northern Trail), and the unit contact person along with their email address and phone number.<p>

<p>The start of the school year is the time to recruit new members. COVID makes even short-term planning challenging, but Circle Ten and the Northern Trail membership committee are working to make it successful. Our emphasis is on recruiting new Cub Scouts and there are plenty of materials available at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources</a>. There is an order form link on that page where you can order Cub Scout Business Cards, Scouts BSA Business Cards, Door Hangers (Cub Specific), Sticky Notes (Cub Specific), Yard Sign for families (Cub only), Yard Sign for the community (Generic Join Scouting), and customized videos which will include things such as your unit, a contact with phone and/or email, a date for a meeting, etc. Every Scouting family should have a yard sign, either Cub Specific or generic. Yard signs will demonstrate that Scouting is thriving in Northern Trail. Please contact Membership Chair Bram Franklin to coordinate, ask questions or address concerns at (214)-609-9089 or <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com">bramfranklin@gmail.com</a></p>
 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">ALT / IOLS Training</strong></p>
<p>This training is for Leaders in the ScoutsBSA program and is targeted at leaders and parents who want to learn the details of how a troop operates. Emphasis is placed on Scout-Led activities and how to manage troop meetings and campouts. You learn by taking on the role of a scout and learn the ropes just as the scouts do in an actual unit. It's a fun rewarding activity and you will meet other scouting adults who are facing the same challenges. The Adult Leader Specific or ALT portion of the program is in a classroom setting and meets twice. The first meeting is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, September 30th at 7:00PM</span> and the second session is the following <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday October 7th at 7:00PM</span>. Location is TBD. <strong>Introduction to Outdoor Leaders Skills</strong> is an actual scout campout over the weekend of <span style="font-weight:bold;">October 17th and 18th</span> at Camp Wisdom. The campout planning will be a part of the ALT classroom training. Registration is required. Registration coming soon.</p> 
 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Position Training</strong></p>
<p>Adults in leadership positions, Den leaders, Cubmasters, Scoutmasters and Crew Advisers must be position trained. Please make plans to get trained. In addition to specific training for your position, hazardous weather training is required. </p>
<p><a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/Documents/PositionTrainedCourses.pdf">Here</a> is a chart which explains the training requirements for each scouting position.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">Popcorn</a></strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 has put significant financial strain on the council. Popcorn sales help units raise money for their programs and scout accounts. The popcorn program has adapted to the new normal and there are innovative ways to sell. Check out the details and get <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">signed</a> up today.</p>
<p> You can go to a warehouse club and buy a big box of microwave popcorn with each bag costing less than 30 cents. If you go to a movie theater the price of a bucket of popcorn might approach $10.00. Our popcorn sales support both the unit selling the popcorn and Circle Ten Council. Every unit should sell popcorn this year! </p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">BAT Training Canceled</strong></p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
