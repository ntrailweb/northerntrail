<p style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Why Participate?</strong></p>


<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://bsaseabase.org/scouting/about/annualreports/2013_one.aspx">One Oath, One Law, One Movement</a></strong></p>
<p>At most Scout meetings we have an opening and the opening usually involves presenting the colors and reciting the Cub Scout promise, Scout oath or Venturing oath. It's important to remember that scouting exists not to entertain, but to achieve the aims embodied in the Scout Oath and Law.  The methods of the program help to achieve the aims.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px;"><strong>Action Needed</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Is Your Unit Recharter Past Due?</strong></p>

<p><img align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/paper_work_50.png">Some units in Northern Trail have lapsed charters.  This means that these units are about to be dropped.  Don't let this happen. Unit commissioners and the district executive are available to assist you with the process.  Don't wait until the last minute.  Even if you are not the unit chairman or leader, getting the re-charter done is everyone's job.  If your leaders have been asking for paperwork or needed youth protection training, please help them out by completing these tasks. <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/re-charter-checklist">More Information</a></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Camp Card Sales</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://mt.ntrail.org/images/camp_card_small.png" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Camp Cards are a great opportunity for your scouts to earn money for camp and help support the scout program at the same time.  It's not too late to get involved.  Contact Jesus Vazquez (469.418.3231) or Tim McConville (214-773-0848) for assistance.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Training</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/trained_small.png" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Scouting is a unique program and the execution is not intuitive. Every adult in a leadership position must be trained.  However all adults should be trained. If you are trained, your scout will get more out of the program. parents have The training is first rate and it's fun.  So don't put it off, get trained.  Every registered adult in the program must have youth protection training and some activities like Twilight Camp and Summer Camp require the Face to Face version of this training. <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/boy-scout-leader-specific-begins-3182015">Boy Scout Leader Specific</a></strong> Training, <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/outdoor-leader-skills-weekend-410-122015">Outdoor Leader Skills Training</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/wilderness-first-aid-5282015-5312015">Wilderness First Aid</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/ypt-face-face-council">Face to Face Youth protection</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://circleten.org/wood-badge">Wood Badge</a></strong> now available.

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Help Needed</strong></p>

<p>Scouting is a volunteer organization and without willing adults the program would not function.</p> <p>Volunteers are needed in your immediate unit and this covers the range of duties from drivers, food at events, assistance with activities, unit leaders and merit badge counselors to name a few.  Get involved, both you and your scout will benefit! If you are a leader and need help, ask!</p>
<p>At the district level we need help with district activities. At the moment we are in particular need of people to help with the upcoming Twilight Camp.  If you know of someone who would be great volunteer, please encourage them to help.
