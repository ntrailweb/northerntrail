<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Talent Stack</strong> </p>
<p>In the business world we see a constant stream of books with the next great concept for success and a recent one is "building a talent stack." Not really a new idea, just a different twist. The point is that most of us will never reach the pinnacle of performance in any one skill, however the combination of skills can make a huge difference in our individual success. 
Scouting is a terrific way to build a talent stack. Beginning with the scout oath and law our scouts internalize from the very beginning the importance of these qualities and responsibilities. Scouting then exposes our scouts to the outdoors and takes them out of their comfort zone and challenges them to adapt to new situations and solve problems. 
Through the advancement process our scouts are tested and must demonstrate proficiency in a number of vital life skills from first aid to financial literacy. The merit badge program with the essential required set and a smorgasbord of topics covering just about any profession, gives scouts the opportunity to experience a taste of a future career.</p> 
<p>A critical skill scouts learn is both how to lead and work effectively with leaders, both good and bad. Leadership is hard and being exposed to the challenges of leadership under difficult conditions is wonderful preparation for life.</p><p>Scouting is much more than simple entertainment; it is supplemental education in vital life skills.
</p> 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>The re-charter process is now underway, and you can begin the process. Every unit must complete the re-charter process at this time each year. </p>
<p>There are 3 scheduled recharter clinics set, all at FUMC-Richardson all starting at 7:00 pm. The dates are November 11, November 30, and December 9.</p>
<p>If you need additional help, please contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>Every year many units must scramble at the last minute to complete this important task. This makes it hard on everyone involved in process, please get started today. If you are not directly involved in the re-charter, you still need to get your dues paid and complete youth protection training if you have an expiring YPT card.</p>

<p>We have good and bad news.

We congratulate her on her new position and wish her well. She will be missed.</p>

You can contact him via email at <a href="mailto:Michael.Garcia@scouting.org">Michael.Garcia@scouting.org</a> or by phone at 214.985.1812.
