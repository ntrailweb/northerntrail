<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Volunteers</strong> </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that scouting is a volunteer fueled organization. These volunteers are just like everyone else, they have jobs, family and the associated challenges. The real difference is that they put their belief in the benefits of the program into action. The satisfaction of making a difference in the lives of our youth is the only payment they receive.  They deserve your support and encouragement. Without help, these volunteers will become overwhelmed and discouraged.  An overwhelmed and discouraged volunteer won't remain a volunteer!  When they ask for help with events and scouting activities, please step up and lend a hand.  You can encourage a hardworking volunteer by nominating them for formal recognition. <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html">Here</a> is how you can do so.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable</strong> </p>
<p>Roundtable is for everyone, parents and front line leaders.  Bring the whole family! Refreshments will be served.</p><p>The re-charter process and Nature around us are the themes this month. If you can't attend in person, the meeting will be on Zoom as well.<br />
