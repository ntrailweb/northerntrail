<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Share the load, how to recruit parents to help</strong></p>
<p><i>(Reprint of an article submitted by Rachel Cahill a few years ago.)</i></p>
<p>One thing that you have to learn as a leader is to ask for help. The success of your program depends on establishing a good set of people to help the group move. Taking on the leadership position is a lot of work and if you try to be the parent committee too, there is just not enough of you to accomplish all that needs to be accomplished and things will inevitably fall through the cracks. At the beginning of the year, establish the feeling of the group as a family that has to work together to accomplish great things. Let your parents know that this group runs together and it is not just one or a few people doing everything. We all need to work together to make it successful. We need YOU! Then, don't let that momentum go!</p>

<p>The big question that always comes up is HOW to get parents to help. We're all working parents and have other commitments outside of scouting, so you're likely to get a lot of shoulder shrugs or no replies when you send out a mass email to ask the group for someone to step up. What I do for each camp-out, fundraiser booth, trash bash, banquet, etc. is to ask someone directly to accept the position as that event's coordinator. You're likely to get a good reaction if you ask a parent to take on ONE event, not the events for the entire year. Setting up individual event coordinators is also a great way to get MANY parents involved in your program instead of just a few. They all feel invested in the group and really get excited to see the good that the group is doing.

Using a free tool like signupgenius.com is a great way to coordinate events. We use a new sign-up for each event so everyone can RSVP. Now, you can even accept payments through PayPal on the site, so if you are purchasing tickets to go somewhere and need to collect money it's all done. For camp-outs, we include sign-up options for food committee and activity committee. For fundraising booths, we set up time slots for parents to work and then for 3 scouts to work during that "shift".

The most important part of getting parents to help you is to make them feel a part of the process. If they are invested in the group, they will step up to help in whatever way they can or partner with someone to accomplish great things in the interest of your child!</p>
