<h2>Sunday July 4, 2021, Happy Independence Day!</h2>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Brave</strong></p>
<p>From the Scout Handbook - "Brave. Face difficult situations even when you feel afraid. Do what you think is right despite what others might be doing or saying." Standing up for what you believe can be difficult, but it is important to do so. Our success as a society depends on honest discussion. History is filled with examples of whole countries drifting off course with terrible consequences. Leaders, encourage your scouts to be <span style="font-weight:bold;">Brave</span>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Need help? Ask! </strong></p>
<p>I have been volunteering as a scouter for a very long time and by far the most common lament I hear is; "I can’t get anyone to help me." Trust me this is not a new problem, and it is a function of human nature. There are two issues at work here, first everyone is busy and fear that this new task will force giving up on something else that needs to be done. The second issue is simply that most people want to help, just not today! Maybe next week! Of course, next week never comes.</p>
<p>So, what to do? Broadcasting that you need help with a particular task via an email announcement by itself will rarely yield results. Very often, the best people for the task are already busy and are not likely to speak up, at least for today!</p>
<p>The key is to make the needs known and then make individual requests. Start with well defined tasks which are not open ended. "Can you drive scouts to the upcoming campout?" "Can you show the TFC scouts how to tie some common knots?"</p>
<p>The most important thing is even if you get turned down, keep asking. Persistence is the key to success. Once you get someone to help, good things will happen. They will learn that it is not as big a burden as they thought and additionally, they find the activity enjoyable and feel satisfaction for their efforts. Do not forget to thank them for their help.</p>
<p>So, when you need help, ask, and keep asking until you get it!

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable</strong> 7:30pm Thursday, August 12, 2021</strong></p>
<p>The topic this month will be Den Chiefs. Perhaps the most misunderstood and under utilized position of responsibility for members of Scouts BSA, Venturing and Sea Scouts. Who can be a den chief, who selects den chiefs, and what do they do? If you are a leader in a Cub Scout pack or a leader in a troop, crew or ship join our next roundtable to learn more about this unique position that straddles Cub Scouting and Scouts BSA. Learn how it can help the packs and dens go and how it can serve as a recruiting tool for troops.</p>
<p>More details will be posted soon.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Summer Water Safety</strong></p>
<p>With summer weather in full swing, most of us will be getting into the water. With water activities comes the risk of drownings. Some simple steps and positive actions can reduce the number of these tragedies. The most important step with swimming activities is to designate someone to watch the activity without the distractions of conversation with others. With boating activities everyone must have a proper life jacket, no exceptions. Here is a website with more information and free materials to help you put a plan into action: <a href="https://www.poolsafely.gov/">https://www.poolsafely.gov/</a></p>

<p>National Youth Leadership Training is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home troops and in other situations demanding leadership of self and others.</p>
<p>The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO. The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT">Learn more</a>.</p>
