<p>At the close of Twilight Camp the Northern Trail website will permently relocate to <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org">northerntrail.circleten.org</a>.

We have more than ten years of material on current site and it's just not easy or practical to move it all.  <i><strong>The squeeky wheel gets the grease!</strong></i>  Let me know what you want to see moved and we will do our best to accomodate your requests.  Take a look at what is there now and let me know what you think needs to be included.</p>
