<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouting Blog</strong></p>

<p>I don't have a lot of material this week, so I am re-printing a scouting blog originally submitted by Chuck Holden.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Volunteer or Voluntold?</strong></p>

<p>Time is precious, we all have pressures for this valuable commodity but one of the things that makes the USA the country it is when compared to others is the willingness of citizens to give back in the form of volunteer service. No other country in the world depends so much on volunteer effort; and in no other country have citizens accepted so universally the idea that volunteer service is a <strong>requirement</strong> of good citizenship. Since most Americans accept this principle, and since there is no shortage of good causes to serve, each of us must make a choice; do we volunteer or do we have to be voluntold?</p>

<p>Scouting thrives because of its volunteers and could not exist without them. The question is, why should you choose Scouting for your volunteer efforts? Perhaps some of the following will help you decide.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is more important than family? Do you really want to make a difference for your children? I&rsquo;m guessing 100% of you will answer that nothing in our secular lives is more important than our families and we all really want to make a difference for our spouses and children. Scouting is a program of values and quality development of its youth members. There is nothing else available that has consistently demonstrated this for more than 100 years in America and abroad.</li>
<li>Do you care about children and young people in general? If you care, then we are the organization for you and you are for us.</li>
<li>Do you care about the future? Most of us keep pretty busy with our everyday lives and everyday issues, but if you really care about the future of your country and its children then you&rsquo;ll find volunteer service in Scouting amazingly satisfying. One of the best ways to have a direct hand in shaping the future is to help young people who will ultimately own it and control it.</li>
<li>Would you like your volunteer service to be different from your everyday work? Scouting is very different from what most of us do on a daily basis, which you might find interesting and refreshing. And, even though you may bring skills to Scouting that you use in your occupation, sharing your expertise and experiences are invaluable to our young people. The payoff is the mentoring volunteers bring to the table helps in the development of our future leaders.</li>
<li>Finally, do you enjoy relationships with like-minded people? If so, boy do we have the organization for you! Scouting volunteers all serve a common cause, and it shows in our relationships with each other. We know why we are here and we are dedicated and enthusiastic about what we are doing.</li>

<p>If you have been involved in scouts for a while and particularly if your Scout has moved on, commissioner service is a great way to keep up with scouting, continue to provide a valuable service, and make a difference. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioner-service"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Continue reading</span></a></p>
