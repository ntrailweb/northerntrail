<p>Does your unit need to sign-up for the 2020 popcorn sale? Here are some incentives, if a Scout sells $250 dollars in popcorn they can attend day camp/winter camp for free or $100 dollars off an in-council camp. Click here for more popcorn reward information. For more information please contact Rachel Joslyn at <a href="mailto:Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org">Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org</a>.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has put a significant financial strain on the council.  Popcorn sales is a big part of the income stream for the council and it helps units raise money for their programs and scout accounts.  The popcorn program has adapted to the new normal and there are innovative ways to sell.  Check out the details and get <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">signed</a> up today.</p>
