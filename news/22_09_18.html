<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Be Prepared</strong></p>
<p>We all know the scout motto, but do we take it to heart? Most of us have flown many times, but up in the front, a good fight crew has a little meeting prior to takeoff. The purpose of the meeting is to have a plan if things don't go well. While the likelihood of a problem is very low, they will be prepared based on the factors at hand so they will have a better chance of a good outcome. Most of us in back don't pay as close attention to the safety briefing as we should, but that's part of being prepared.</p>
<p>Life is going to throw our scouts curve balls, we want them to be prepared to act when things go wrong. From the simple case of a broken tent pole to how to deal with a medical emergency. Teach your scouts to be prepared by setting a good example and making it a priority.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">School Night For Scouting</strong> </p>
<p>School nights for scouting are in full swing it is vital that your unit participates. Be sure make these new scouts and their parents feel welcome in your unit. With new scouts come new parents and new parents have enthusiasm, skills, and energy to help your unit thrive.</p>
<p>Please contact Katherine McCrary	<a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a> if you can help with school night for scouting or have questions.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Webelos Woods, November 4-6, 2022</strong></p>
<p>Webelos Woods is an awesome opportunity for Webelos (and their parents) to experience some of the fun that they can look forward to once they cross over into a troop. Troops will host Webelos Scouts from various packs and will form patrols which will include those Webelos Scouts for the weekend. Packs will be assigned to camp with a host Troop by the event staff.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the patrols will rotate in a round-robin style of activities where they can visit with different Troops. Each patrol will learn a variety of different outdoor and Scout skills and put them to use in live demonstrations. On Saturday night, both districts will come together to enjoy a rousing campfire program with yells and skits! There will also be a OA Brotherhood ceremony on Saturday evening.</p>
