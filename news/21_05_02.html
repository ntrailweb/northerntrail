<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Trustworthy</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The first of the 12 points of the scout law is: "A scout is Trustworthy." I do not think it is an accident that this is the first rule since it is so important as an element of character. Our scouts repeat this at almost every meeting, but perhaps we do not attach as much meaning to the word as we should. Other words are associated with being trustworthy; accurate, authentic, authoritative, believable, convincing, credible, dependable, ethical, honest, honorable, mature, principled, realistic, responsible, sensible and truthful. These words start to put some real understanding to what it means to be trustworthy. A trait worth developing and encouraging. Remind your scouts what it means to be trustworthy.</p>

<p>Twilight camp is a week-long late afternoon, early evening event for Cub Scouts. The theme for Twilight Camp this year is "Weird Science." Lots of fun activities are planned in a COVID safe environment. This event will be held, as in the past, at Breckinridge Park in Northeast Richardson. BB guns, archery, crafts, games, egg drop, swaps and more. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NTTwilightCamp">Registration</a> now available. Check out pictures from past Twilight Camps <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/forms-and-more.html#pictures">here</a>. Another benefit is that as an adult, you will enjoy the activity and meet other parents dealing with the many of the same challenges you are facing.</p>
<p>Twilight camp would not be possible without dedicated volunteers. We need help in all program areas including the BB gun range and archery. We also need help to staff the first aid station; EMT, nurse or doctor. Volunteers can be scheduled for one or more days. Contact Hank Voegtle if you can help at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a>.

<p>Bring the family and come join us as we celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Alan Sheppard becoming the first American in space with our STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) themed Roundtable. We'll be launching 2-liter soda bottle rockets throughout the entire evening as different groups have displays on different STEM activities that scouts and units can do. Invited groups include the Dallas Geological Society, the AT&T Professional Engineers, Dr. Kenneth Berry (Lead Author of the Robotics Merit Badge Pamphlet), Dallas Paleontological Society and the Richardson Wireless Association.</p>

<p>So at 7:00 PM on Thursday, May 13th, bring your camp chairs, picnic dinners, 2-liter soda bottle rockets and family and join us in the remote parking lot of First United Methodist Church of Richardson for a celebration of STEM. West of the church, field west side of Custer Road.</p>
