<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">About Northern Trail District</strong></p>
<p>Circle Ten Council is divided into districts, each of which cover a specific geographical area. Northern Trail district covers the same area as the Richardson Independent School district. This includes most of Richardson and parts of Garland, Dallas and Plano. There is a <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/district-leadership-0.html">team</a> of volunteers in place at the district level who are there to help make scouting a success. Each unit is assigned a unit <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">commissioner</a> who is an experienced scouting leader who can answer questions and help you make your unit successful.</a> <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/about-northern-trail.html">More information.</a></p>

<h2>Other Opportunities</h2>

<h2>Fund Raising</h2>

<p>Like it or not, any organization requires funds to make it operate. Scouting is a very efficent operation with volunteer leaders who do the heavy lifting. We have camps, offices and professional scouters who provide essential services. These professionals represent a small fraction of the total. Funds are raised in several ways including fees, popcorn sales, camp cards and direct contributions from individuals and groups. All of these income sources have declined due to COVID has this has placed a severe strain on the organization and it is vital that we make an extra effort to get back on track.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Friends of Scouting</strong></p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we need robust programs to teach the next generation life skills learned by being involved in Scouting. FOS funding helps us to provide all Scouts with worthwhile activities and valuable resources including our top notch facilities. Please consider one of the following FOS giving options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going on-line today and making a personal contribution (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021">https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021</a> please enter "Northern Trail" in the district name field!)</li>

<li>Reaching out to your employer for corporate matching funds</li>

<li>Volunteering to help with our fundraising efforts through networking including social media</li>

<li>Inviting one of our FOS speakers to your next Scouting event such as a Blue & Gold or Court of Honor</li>
</ul>
<p>***If your pack, troop, crew or ship is only holding virtual events, we would love a chance to speak during your next online meeting.***
