	<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>SAFE Checklist</strong></p>

<p>From a recent Scouting Wire article and <a href="https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/safe/"><strong>scouting.org</strong></a></p>
<p>Scouts and their parents expect all Boy Scouts of America activities to be conducted safely. To ensure the safety of participants, the Boy Scouts of America expects leaders to use the four points of SAFE when delivering the Scouting program.</p>

<p><strong>Supervision</strong></p>

<p>Youth are supervised by qualified and trustworthy adults who set the example for safety.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>

<p>Activities are assessed for risks during planning. Leaders have reviewed applicable program guidance or standards and have verified the activity is not prohibited. Risk avoidance or mitigation is incorporated into the activity.</p>

<p><strong>Fitness And Skill</strong></p>

<p>Participants’ Annual Health and Medical Records are reviewed, and leaders have confirmed that prerequisite fitness and skill levels exist for participants to take part safely.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment And Environment</strong></p>

<p>Safe and appropriately sized equipment, courses, camps, campsites, trails, or playing fields are used properly. Leaders periodically check gear use and the environment for changing conditions that could affect safety.</p>

<p>Details may be found <a href="https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/safe/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
