<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Overdue Re-Charters -- <i>Hard Deadline March 1st!</i></strong></p>
<p>We still have several units which have not completed their re-charters. This includes some applications which are incomplete or have problems. <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">March 1st</span> is the absolute deadline after which your unit can't be re-chartered an must be created from scratch. Common problems are missing YPT cards or adult applications. <strong> <i>This is a serious problem.</i></strong> Your scouts cannot advance or use the council facilities. Our District Executive will be available to assist with unit re-charters and youth/adult applications. If you need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to him. <br />

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouting for Food</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in Scouting for Food. You have made a difference in our community. If you did not participate this year, why not? Consider the thousands of pounds of food for needed families which was not collected simply because we did not cover every neighborhood in the district. Please put scouting for food on your unit calendar and plan to participate next year.</p> 
<p>Thanks to Hunter Miller our scouting for food chair who coordinated this year's event.</p>
