<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Scouts Deserve Trained Leaders</p>
<p>
Too often we think we understand how to perform a task, when in fact the problem is more complicated and difficult than we imagined. We dive right in and get all tangled up and frustrated. Worse yet, once we really understand something it often seems trivial.</p>
<p>Scouting is a unique idea, and the foundational principles are not immediately obvious. Yes, most people know about scouting but are vague on the details. New leaders will often think, this can’t be too hard, I can just "wing it!"</p>
<p>As we all know, "winging it" is normally not a very good idea.</p>
<p>Training will bring the combined knowledge of more than 100 years of scouting and the experiences of millions of volunteers who have trod the path before you. Believe me there are rocks in the road and if you don’t know about them you will get tripped up.</p>
<p>The best thing about training is that you will learn the tried and tested recipes for success. First you will learn about the AIMs and methods of scouting which are the foundational ideas. You will learn about the organizational structure, safety protocols and details associated with meetings, camping, and unit operations. You will learn about available resources and get introduced to both experienced scouters in your district and other new leaders. You will learn from each other as well as the trainers.</p>
<p>Scouts deserve the best program we can deliver. Scouts deserve leaders who can deliver the gift of scouting. Scouts deserve trained leaders. Get trained and send others in your unit to training.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership + Recruiting</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>School Night For Scouting:</strong>As of October 13th, we’ve recruited 360 scouts into Northern Trail Packs! 5,188 new scouts across the council. Woohoo!! THANK YOU to all the pack unit leaders who have represented their pack at the local SNFS nights and helped get those new parents plugged in! You play such a crucial role in furthering Scouting, and we thank you for your efforts! Additionally, a BIG thank you to the scouters who volunteered to help with our overall recruitment efforts, either giving a SNFS presentation or providing crucial support in the background… Bram Franklin, Daniela Gatlin, Dave Hapeman, Dory Petsrillo, Hank Voegtle, Ken Weitzel, Kristine Schwope, Lynda McKnight, Michael Garcia, Patti Otte, Patrick Murphy, Rebecca Bradley, and Tim McConville. We appreciate you! If you can help or need information, please contact Katherine McCrary at 	<a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org"><strong>Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</strong></a>.</li>

<li><strong>Follow up on New Members:</strong> Pack Unit Leaders, don't forget to check in with every prospective parent that signed-in on the attendance rosters from your SNFS events. A followup phone call, email or even a postcard can make the difference. Remember, you understand the value of the scout program, with new parents you must sell the program.</li>

<li><strong>Grow your Membership:</strong>
Growing your membership should be a year round activity. You should always be looking for opportunities to recruit more scouts into the program! Pack and troop leaders, if you'd like to hold a fall recruitment event for your unit, the council can assist you in promoting it. Email <a href="mailto:katherine.mccrary@scouting.org"><strong>katherine.mccrary@scouting.org</strong></a> to create and print fliers to be distributed in your community.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">It is Time to Recognize Adult Scouters</p>
<p>It is this time of year when we recognize our fellow scouters for the exemplary volunteer work that they do at the unit, district, and council levels. We remain thankful to them for their tireless service.</p>
<p>We have several awards to recognize these individuals beginning at the unit level with the Your Extraordinary Service Award or the Y.E.S. Award. At the district level we have two awards: the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Applications for these awards must be submitted no later than Friday, December 1st. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>At the Council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Applications for the Silver Beaver Award must be received no later than <strong>Monday, November 20th</strong>. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>Self-nominations will not be accepted.</p>
<p>More information, including the submission details of these awards, is available <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/adult-recognition-0.html#overlay-context="><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <strong>mzi@gatech.edu</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>The annual recharter process is a critical activity which must be completed for your unit to continue to operate. A charter is an agreement between your chartering organization, the Circle Ten Council and the National BSA organization. Every member of your unit both scout and adult must be properly accounted for with paid dues and any required training. Please do your part. Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>Youth Protection Training Current?</strong></a></p>
<p>Your unit cannot complete Recharter if your YPT card is not current. Time flies, check your card and take the training if needed. Get training at: <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. Don't wait, get done now.</p>
<p>Unit leaders, check the status of the adults in your unit now online.</p> 
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>Financial Aid</strong></a>
<p>Financial aid is available for families who need help with scouting expenses. More information available <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Process</p>
<p>Units! You should've received an email on October 1st from Daniel Murphy about the 2023-2024 recharter process. It has begun! Make sure you start collecting recharter dues from your existing scouts… Pro-tip: set an internal deadline for when parents need to turn in their money! Not sure how to navigate recharter? More information <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
