<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Second Annual Outdoor Adventure</strong></p>
<p>Mark your Calendar; Saturday September 10, 2016, Yale Park, <a href="http://ow.ly/IZ6F302EEdm">Map</a></p>
<p>Help us kick off our Fall recruiting by participating in the 2nd Annual Outdoor Adventure community event! Northern Trail District and the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas are sponsoring a family day at the park for people residing in the Richardson Independent School District. Last year we had over 25 activities and hundreds of families around the Richardson area enjoying a fun-filled day of games and scout skills.</p>
<p>This event is a wonderful opportunity to promote your pack, troop or crew and demonstrate how much fun it is to be a Scout! If you would like to sponsor and staff an activity, the signup form is now available <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/outdoor-adventure-activity-signup">here.</a></strong> If you have any questions, please email Marjie Price at <a href="mailto:msmn1204@gmail.com">msmn1204@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Roundtable, Tuesday September 13, 2016, 7:00PM</strong></p>
<p>First United Methodist Church<br />
Education Building Rm 212<br />
Focus: Training opportunities.</p>
<p>Please take advantage of this unique discussion about the various training opportunities available to you. Training starts in October. This is the time of the year to make your plans to attend, and to sign up.</p>
<p>Who needs training? Everyone who has a son in scouting.</p>
<p>Why should you go through training?</p>
<ol>
	<li>To enhance your son&rsquo;s scouting experience. The discussion at this Roundtable will help you find your place within your son&rsquo;s troop as a member of the adult team. Your participation has a great and lasting influence on his scouting success.</li>
	<li>To insure everyone in the unit is on the same page. A first step towards troop unification is everyone understanding how scouts works. Training is important. Even if you do not plan to be a part of your son&rsquo;s troop&rsquo;s adult team, you should understand why leaders are doing what they are doing.</li>
	<li>To learn skills which also apply outside of scouting. It is common to hear adults comment about how the things they learned in scout training have helped them in their own carriers, and family relationships.</li>
</ol>
Please, join us for this interesting and informative interactive discussion. Longtime Northern Trail trainer, Mike Reisinger, is our guest speaker. He will be telling us about all the training available. There&rsquo;s a lot going beginning with Youth Protection training, and going on through to the University of Scouting and Wood Badge.</p>
<p>This is a discussion you will only hear at Roundtable. Come and meet other Scouters. Share ideas and information. We will have fun, fellowship, and we have great door prizes such as gift cards from Kenny&rsquo;s Italian Kitchen.</p>
<p>Your participation is important to us, and your attendance will be greatly appreciated. We always have a place for you at Roundtable.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub-a-Palooza (Northern Trail to Adventure)</strong></p>
<p>Save the date, Saturday October 1st, all day. Note a change from the date presented at Program Preview. This is a family Cub Scout Event held at Camp Wisdom. Lot of fun in Cub world and special events for the entire family. More details will be available soon.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fall Training, Mark your Calendar</strong></p>
<p>Training dates have been posted to the calendar. If you have leaders who lack training and need the requirements to become “Trained,” see Leader Training Overview found at www.circle10.org; go to Volunteers and select training. Training is not just for front line leaders. Parents who want their scout to get the most out of the program, should attend training and learn just how the scouting program works. Training will make your job easier and you will get much better results. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/fall-training">Training in Northern Trail</a> Registration now available!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Leader Appreciation Luncheon at Camp Wisdom!, October 8th</strong></p>
<p>Mark your calendars for the Leader Appreciation Lunch October 8th at Camp Wisdom. We had just over 100 people attend last year to explore over 30 booths of program features within Circle Ten and our four outstanding area camps.</p>
<p>Each unit should choose two people to attend this luncheon in their honor. Suggested attendees are decision makers in the unit’s program. BALOO Trained adults, Cub Masters, Scout Master, Advisors, Skippers, Outdoor Committee Members, Senior Patrol Leaders, Crew Presidents, Boatswains, or any other leader that can use the information and needs to meet the people involved in all of these programs. </p>
<p>
This is sure to be another great event. Lunch is provided by the Order of the Arrow Bistro and a small token of appreciation for all the program planning these folks do will be given out as well. More information including a registration link to come. Questions – contact Kim Huff (<a href="mailto:kimhuffdcd@gmail.com">kimhuffdcd@gmail.com</a>). </p>
<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Popcorn</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fall Training, Mark your Calendar</strong></p>
<p>Training dates have been posted to the calendar. If you have leaders who lack training, please insure that they allocate the time to attend training. Training is not just for front line leaders.
