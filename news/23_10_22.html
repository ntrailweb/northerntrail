<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Camp Wisdom Celebrates 100 Years</p>
<p>Camp Wisdom is celebrating 100 years of Scouting, and I wanted to learn more about the story behind this iconic camp. While there is a lot of information available, some of it is inaccurate.</p>
<p>The donation of the land came about due to an accidental encounter by John S. Wisdom. At the time, Wisdom was negative about the new Scouting movement, believing that boys should be doing something useful rather than running around wild. He had a reputation for being a bit grumpy.</p>
<p>One day, while out on his property, Wisdom heard voices on an adjacent plot of land. He investigated and found a troop of Scouts holding a service, giving thanks for the woods, the streams, and the birds. This encounter changed Wisdom's opinion of Scouting, and he invited the Scouts to use his land anytime they wished.</p>
<p>Eventually, Wisdom made the generous donation of his entire farm to the Scouts, and Camp Wisdom was born.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about the history of Camp Wisdom and Scouting in the Circle Ten Council, I recommend the book <i>Where Character is Caught</i> by David C. Scott.
Even 100 years ago, the value of Scouting was recognized, and this triggered amazing generosity of both time and treasure. Scouting is truly a gift!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership + Recruiting</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>School Night for Scouting:</strong>  Fall recruiting is still in process. Northern Trail has done well so far, but we are not done yet.  If you can help or need information, please contact Katherine McCrary at 	<a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org"><strong>Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</strong></a>.</li>

<li><strong>Follow up on New Members:</strong> Pack Unit Leaders, don't forget to check in with every prospective parent that signed-in on the attendance rosters from your SNFS events. A followup phone call, email or even a postcard can make the difference. Remember, you understand the value of the scout program, with new parents you must sell the program.</li>

<li><strong>Grow your Membership:</strong>
Growing your membership should be a year round activity. You should always be looking for opportunities to recruit more scouts into the program! Pack and troop leaders, if you'd like to hold a fall recruitment event for your unit, the council can assist you in promoting it. Email <a href="mailto:katherine.mccrary@scouting.org"><strong>katherine.mccrary@scouting.org</strong></a> to create and print fliers to be distributed in your community.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">It is Time to Recognize Adult Scouters</p>
<p>It is this time of year when we recognize our fellow scouters for the exemplary volunteer work that they do at the unit, district, and council levels. We remain thankful to them for their tireless service.</p>
<p>We have several awards to recognize these individuals beginning at the unit level with the Your Extraordinary Service Award or the Y.E.S. Award. At the district level we have two awards: the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Applications for these awards must be submitted no later than Friday, December 1st. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>At the Council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Applications for the Silver Beaver Award must be received no later than <strong>Monday, November 20th</strong>. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>Self-nominations will not be accepted.</p>
<p>More information, including the submission details of these awards, is available <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/adult-recognition-0.html#overlay-context="><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <strong>mzi@gatech.edu</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>The annual recharter process is a critical activity which must be completed for your unit to continue to operate. A charter is an agreement between your chartering organization, the Circle Ten Council and the National BSA organization. Every member of your unit both scout and adult must be properly accounted for with paid dues and any required training. Please do your part.  Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>Youth Protection Training Current?</strong></a></p>
<p>Your unit cannot complete Recharter if your YPT card is not current. Time flies, check your card and take the training if needed. Get training at: <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. Don't wait, get done now.</p>
<p>Unit leaders, check the status of the adults in your unit now online.</p>

<p>Financial aid is available for families who need help with scouting expenses. More information available <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Process</p>
<p>If you have not started working recharter, now is the time, don't wait. Waiting results in misery for everyone. Not sure how to navigate recharter? More information <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
