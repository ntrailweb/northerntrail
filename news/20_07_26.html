<h2>Sunday July 26, 2020</h2>

<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">COVID-19</span></p>
<p>We continue to monitor the situation. The really good news is that young people are at very low risk compared to older and medically compromised individuals. Bottom line is that we cannot allow the virus to win. We can meet the challenge and continue to live our lives despite the additional difficulties. The key is to use good judgement and be innovative in finding ways to make this work. Outdoor "low density" activities are much safer than indoor "high density" activities. Scouting is an outdoor activity, make use of the outdoors and make scouting work. Maintain good hygiene, social distancing and keep everyone safe while having fun.<p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Training</span></p>
<p>We sound like a broken record, but its true, training makes all the difference. Don't try and wing it! Many have gone before you and worked out methods which are effective. The idea is to achieve the AIMS of scouting and not to get bogged down trying to execute a program you don't understand. Additionally, some of this training is required for the safety and wellbeing of all the participants. Don't put it off any longer put together a training plan today and get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.scouting.org/Documents/PositionTrainedCourses.pdf">Here</a> is a chart which explains the training requirements for each scouting position. </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">IT'S YOUR ROUNDTABLE</span> Join the conversation!<p>
<p>Cub Scouts / ScoutsBSA<br />
<p>What is Roundtable? Here is how the BSA defines this important part of being a Scout leader:</p>
<p>The objectives of roundtables are to provide leaders with program ideas; information on policy and events; and training opportunities. It is a forum for sharing experiences and enjoying fun and fellowship with other Scout leaders.</p>
<p>Roundtables play a significant role in providing continuous training for unit leaders. But more importantly, in our changing world, Roundtables give leaders, volunteers and parents tools that they can use now.</p>
<p>A fun environment creates excitement around the coming month of activities and program for unit leaders to carry back for implementation in their units, providing knowledge, program ideas, skills, and fun resources.</p>
<p>Northern Trailâ€™s first Roundtable for 2020-21 will be online on August 13. Details will be coming soon.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">The Gathering. Saturday, September 19th</span></p>
<p>Venturers are invited to come enjoy the day socializing and participating in activities like shooting sports, climbing towers, horseback riding, and swimming! A catered BBQ lunch is provided Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>The event is held at Camp Trevor Rees-Jones and is designed to be a single day (Saturday) event. Units desiring to stay overnight are encouraged to do so; however, are responsible for their own meals (with the exception of lunch on Saturday).</p>
<p>More details soon.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
