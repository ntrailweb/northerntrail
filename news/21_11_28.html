<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Simple Things Make a Difference</strong></p>
<p>John Wooden was the head coach for the UCLA men’s basketball. During his time as the head coach, the UCLA Bruins won 10 national championships in 12 years. Even with all the national championships he accumulated, you could find him each week sweeping the entire gym floor.</p>
<p>Something so simple has a major impact. Your ability to impact, serve people and to do the little things will attract others, which in turn will grow your influence, and with influence it gives you the ability to lead. The equation is that simple. Serve. Attract. Influence. Impact. A simple yet powerful message that each of us can implement in our roles as community and business leaders. Now, go find your broom.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>This recharter is easier than ever. However easy as it is, waiting until the last minute is tough on everyone involved. If your unit uses Scoutbook, it can complete recharter through Scoutbook. If you use another program, you can access recharter through the Internet Advancement portal. Any questions or problems please contact your unit commissioner or Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a></p>
<p>There are 2 scheduled recharter clinics available, all at FUMC-Richardson all starting at 7:00 pm. The dates are <span style="font-weight:bold;">November 11, November 30, and December 9</span>.</p>
<p>Here are some documents which may help:<br />

<p>If you are not directly involved in the re-charter, you still need to get your dues paid and complete youth protection training if you have an expiring YPT card.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Membership</strong> </p>
