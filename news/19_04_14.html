<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/cc_infosheet.pdf">Camp Cards</a> </strong></p>
<p>There is still time to sell Camp Cards.  If you need cards, please  contact our District Executive, Jorge Salazar, ASAP. Do you need more cards to sell? Additional cards can be picked up by your Unit Camp Card Chair from both the Fairview Office and Harry Hines Office from the Registration Desk. Money from the sale can also be turned in to the registration desk. If you need more cards and cannot make it out to either office, contact our Camp Card Chair, Dave Hapeman, <a href="mailto:dave.hapeman@gmail.com">dave.hapeman@gmail.com</a>, or our District Executive, Jorge Salazar <a href="mailto:Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org">Jorge.Salazar@scouting.org</a>.  Donâ€™t forget last day to turn in money and unsold cards is May 17th. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/cc_infosheet.pdf">More information</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-2019">Twilight Camp</a>, June 3-7, 2019</strong></p>
<p><img style="max-width:30%;" hspace="5" align="right" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/tc_2019_patch_150.png">Dear Cub Scout Leaders and Parents,<br />Twilight Camp is 7 weeks away! More important regular registration ends in 2 weeks! In the past you have been able to sign up for camp before the deadline to save your spots and pay after Camp Card sales ended. This year, with the change in the registration system that option is not available and the full fee must be paid by April 30 to avoid paying the late fee. This is not a Northern Trail decision and we regret this change.</p><p>Next, the new system has another problem related to the one discussed above. When a registration is made the new system will not save your registrations without some payment being made. To avoid this, please try to make a full payment. If you or your unit is unable to make a full payment, please make a partial payment ($5.00, for example) and pay the balance later-but remember that the full fee must be made by April 30 to avoid the late fee.</p><p>Finally, Twilight Camp needs staff, especially for BB guns and archery. There is  Rangemaster training for both Archery and BB guns on May 4 and everyone thinking of working or assisting on the ranges should take this training. To assist contact, Hank Voegtle at <a href="phone:214-769-5040">214-769-5040</a> or <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com"></a>. Also, register for staff following the link below.<br /><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-2019">More information and registration.</a></strong><br /><a href="http://circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/nt_2019_day_camp_flier.pdf">Promotional flyer to hand out.</a></strong></p>
