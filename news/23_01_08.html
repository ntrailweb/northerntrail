		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Winter Camping</strong></p>

		<p>Many troops try and go on monthly campouts, but this time of year might seem like a bad time. Actually, winter camping can be very enjoyable. On one of my unit’s most memorable campouts, we woke up to a blanket of snow which covered our tents right here in Texas. Sitting around a campfire in cold weather is a rare treat for scouts in this part of the country and an experience not to be missed. Having a pleasant experience winter camping is all about preparation. In our climate most sleeping bags are more than adequate. Outside, the key is to have warm clothing including a stocking hat and gloves. Think layers, so you can adjust for comfort. That hat is important when you sleep and can make a world of difference. Plan hot meals in the evening and in the morning. Food and hot liquids will really warm you up quickly. True misery is being both cold and wet. Make sure scouts have good rain gear and a change of clothes should they get wet. If your sleeping bag gets wet, particularly down filled bags, the insulating properties are severely compromised. So be sure and protect your sleeping bag so it does not get wet. Experienced cold weather campers will keep their bags stuffed or bundled up off the bottom of the tent when not in use, so they won't get wet. Make sure your tent is in good condition and use a ground cloth to stay dry. Don’t miss the opportunity for a memorable camping experience.</p>

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>

		<p>We hope your re-charter is done, but if not, time is running out. It won't happen immediately, but if your charter drops, it's much more involved than getting it done before the deadline. There is a little grace period, but in the meantime your scouts can't advance and you cannot operate your unit.</p>

		<p>Save the hassle and get it done. Help is available.</p>

		<p>Contact the <a href="mailto:steve_bloberger@icloud.com">district commissioner</a> for assistance.</p>

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">District Awards Banquet</strong></p>

		<p>The date for the dinner has been changed to <strong>February 23, 2023.</strong> COVID 19 put a real dent in our ability to recognize hard working volunteers and leaders in the district. In January we are planning to resume our annual district awards banquet. Expect a great meal, inspiring keynote speaker and a very enjoyable evening. </p>
