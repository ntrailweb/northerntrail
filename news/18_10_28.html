<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friends of Scouting (FOS)</strong></p>
<p>This is the opportunity we all look forward to each year to be able to be included in helping the Scouting program with a charitable donation. FOS presenters are getting trained in a few weeks and we need YOUR unit to sign up for our volunteers to visit. Please email your dates for your Blue and Gold and Courts of Honor so we can get your presenter scheduled.</p>
<p>Remember, FOS is our way to help keep costs low in Circle 10 Council. FOS money helps provide the scouting program for scouts who financially can't afford to join, it helps train Scouters who can't afford to attend training, it help maintain our camps. Remember, our entire recharter fee/registration fee goes directly to National BSA, nothing stays at Council 10.</p>
<p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:marie.baert@verizon.net">marie.baert@verizon.net</a> to schedule your FOS presentation.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong></p>
<p>Scouting is possible only because of the tireless work of countless volunteers. You will find these volunteers in your unit, organizing events, helping with activities and working directly with the youth. They are the parents, committee members, Den Leaders, Scout Leaders and Venturing Advisers. Beyond the unit at the district level are volunteers who mentor unit leaders as unit commissioners. District volunteers also work to offer training and district activities. Other volunteers work to help start new units and recruit new scouts. Then there are those who work on the critical task of raising the need funds for council operations. At the council level, volunteers serve in many of the same capacities but at a larger scale. It is fitting that we recognize these volunteers at all levels and a mechanism is in place to do just that. At the unit level we have the Y.E.S. award which recognizes volunteers in individual units. At the district level we have the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Finally at the council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Nominations come from the scouting community and that means you. Please take a minute and review the awards and consider someone you know who should be recognized. More information and nomination forms may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">here</a>.</p>
