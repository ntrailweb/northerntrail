The areas that we need staff are Scout Skills, Crafts, Webelos Adventures, registration(helping Barbara), the Wood Shop and all Ranges. Please sign up <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/twilight-camp-staff-registration">here</a></strong> and let us know what area you would like to work. Both adult and youth staff are needed. Face-to-face YPT is required for staff 18 years and older. Sign up today! </p>
