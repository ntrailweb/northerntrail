<p>Every year we leave areas uncovered in Northern Trail.  These areas represent food that could have been placed in the hands of needy families.  This happened because we failed to simply go out and get it. This year we can change that by covering those areas. If your unit has not signed up for an area, please do so today.  If you have signed up for an area, please consider adopting an area which has not been spoken for.  There are several which have not been covered in several years.  Contact: Hunter Miller to claim your area.  <a href="mailto:hmiller002.tx@gmail.com">hmiller002.tx@gmail.com</a>.  <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-2018">More Information</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Departure of District Executive Chad Caudle</strong></p>
<p>Our district executive has accepted a sales position in Oklahoma City in the chemical industry.  He was recruited because of his outstanding performance in Northern Trail.  During Chad’s tenue, membership increased dramatically and our financial performance was excellent.  He will be sorely missed.   In the interim, until a new executive has been hired, please contact Michael Hunt at <a href="mailto:Michael.Hunt@scouting.org">Michael.Hunt@scouting.org</a>.</p>
