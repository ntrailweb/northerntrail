<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Half Full or Half Empty?</strong></p>

<p>We are living in challenging times and it's easy to get into a bunker mentality and just wait for the storm to pass.</p>
<p>This is a poor strategy for several reasons, first of all our scouts deserve the opportunity to experience scouting and grow. We've lost a lot of ground over the past year which we need to make up. So while we can't deliver the program in the same way as we have in the past, we can adapt to the new reality. Even after the situation improves, it will still be some time before we will have a more normal environment and some things will never quite be the same. So, yes, the glass is half full, our scouts can meet, lead, advance, learn scouting skills and go camping. Yes, it is more challenging than it has been in the past, but it can be done and done safely. Resolve to conquer the bunker mentality and get <strong>scout active!</strong> If you need some guidance on how to proceed, review the safe restart <a href="https://ntrail.org/docs/Safe_Restart_Scouting_Checklist.pdf">document.</a> You can also contact your unit <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">commissioner</a> for information.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Serious Financial Difficulties</strong></p>

<p>Because of the pandemic, Circle Ten is challenged financially. Scouting in Circle Ten receives funding from a number of sources; Popcorn sales, Camp Cards, Friends of Scouting and community support. All of these income sources are down substantially.</p>
<p>We owe it to current and future generations of scouts to keep Circle Ten financially healthy. If you can help, please consider making a pledge or an additional pledge. You can do it <a href="https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021">online.</a>

<p>Twilight camp is a week-long late afternoon, early evening event for Cub Scouts. The theme for Twilight Camp this year is "Weird Science."

BB guns, archery, crafts, games, egg drop, swaps and more. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NTTwilightCamp">Registration</a> now available.
