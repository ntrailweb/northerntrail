<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-2019">Twilight Camp Staff Needed</a>, June 3-7, 2019</strong></p>
<p>Twilight Camp needs your help!!! Unlike resident camps, Twilight Camp relies on volunteers to staff the camp. Camp has three phases; set-up, camp and takedown. We need volunteers for each phase. During camp we need leaders for Tigers, Wolves, Bears and Webelos activities. Can’t devote the whole week? We can still use your help. Sign up and let us know what days you can’t make it or what area you would like to staff. We will work to accommodate all request, but staff assignments are subject to change for camp needs. 
This is a great opportunity for youth service hours. Any youth Scouts BSA age (10-17) can register as Staff and will be a Junior Helper. This is a “Twilight Camp" which means that all activities occur between 4:00PM and 8:30PM. No need to take a full day off from work, most can adjust their work schedule to accommodate the activity.</p>
<p>Please contact Hank Voegtle at <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com">hjv3@outlook.com</a> or 214-769-5040 if you have any questions. &nbsp;<a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-2019">http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-2019</a></p>
