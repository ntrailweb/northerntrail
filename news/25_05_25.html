    <p><strong>Dear Council Leadership (Key 3’s) and National High Adventure Base General Managers,</strong></p>

    <p>
      Due to a recent incident involving Range and Target Activities, we are directing an immediate safety stand-down across all councils and National High Adventure Bases.
    </p>

    <p class="notice-header">Effective Immediately:</p>

    <p>
      <strong>All Range and Target Activities must be suspended at your camps and properties. This includes programs involving both Scouting and non-Scouting groups. The stand-down will remain in effect until further notice.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      This action is being taken out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety of all participants and staff. Our National Safeguarding Youth Governance Committee will be convening shortly to review the incident and determine the appropriate path forward. We will provide further guidance on the resumption of Range and Target Activities following that meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
      We appreciate your immediate attention and cooperation in implementing this stand-down. Please ensure this directive is communicated to all relevant staff and volunteers without delay. For further questions, please reach out to Senior Vice President of Program, Shane Calendine, at: 
      <a href="mailto:Shane.Calendine@Scouting.org">Shane.Calendine@Scouting.org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for your continued commitment to safety.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.7em; font-weight:bold;">Troop Fundraising Opportunity</p>
<p style="clear:left;">The Richardson Rotary Club is searching for a scout troop in the Richardson area that would like to help them with their Flag Program. One or two troops are needed to help the Club put out and pick-up flags. This project could be a good income source for a troop’s scout accounts. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.7em; font-weight:bold;">Why Summer Camp Matters in Scouting</p>
<p style="clear:left;">As we look ahead to another great summer, we want to take a moment to highlight why 
  <strong>summer camp is such an essential part of the Scouting experience</strong>.</p>

  <p>Summer camp is more than just tents, campfires, and s'mores. It's where Scouts build independence, 
  resilience, and confidence. In just one week, they learn to lead, solve problems, work as a team, and 
  take care of themselves—and each other. They earn merit badges, try new activities, and make lasting 
  friendships, all while connecting with the outdoors in a way that’s hard to replicate elsewhere.</p>

  <p>These experiences have a lasting impact. Many Scouts return home from camp noticeably more confident 
  and capable. For some, it's their first real step toward becoming a leader.</p>

  <p>None of this would be possible without your support. Whether you volunteer, help fundraise, or 
  simply encourage your Scout to attend, you are helping make these life-changing experiences happen. 
  <strong>Thank you for being such an important part of the journey.</strong></p>

  <p>Let’s make this summer unforgettable!</p>
