<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-2019">Twilight Camp Staff Needed</a>, June 3-7, 2019</strong></p>
<p>Spring is in the air and that means Twilight camp. If you have ever attended camp, you know that it is one of the highlights of a Cub Scout’s year. This event depends entirely on the work of volunteers. Right now, we <i><strong>need</strong></i> volunteers to step up to the plate to make this event the best possible. It's easier for everyone if they get started early and are well prepared. This is a rewarding activity and you will enjoy your time on staff. Even if you can only help one evening, your contribution will be invaluable.</p>

<p>If you are able to help and or know someone who would be a great staff person, please email their name and contact information to Hank Voegtle at <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com">hjv3@outlook.com</a>. All submissions will be kept confidential!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Camporee, March 22-24, 2019</strong></p>
<p>Camporee planning is underway. This year it will be held at Camp Constantin. Expect a high energy event with some great activities and unit competition. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1N55t6xSuk52">Map</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friends of Scouting (FOS)</strong></p>
<p>Scouting needs youth, volunteers and funding. Without all of these elements, the program cannot function. Funding for programs, camps and professional staff come from the local community. A very large fraction of this funding comes from families in scouting. We must communicate this important message to scouting parents across the district. Unit Leaders your help is needed, please make room at your next court of honor or Blue and Gold for a volunteer to make the case for supporting scouting in our community. Contact Marie. Baert <a href="mailto:marie.baert@verizon.net">marie.baert@verizon.net</a> to make the arrangements.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouting for Food 2019</strong></p>
<p>There is still time to participate in this vital annual activity. Scouting for food is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate scouting values. <strong>Saturday February 16th</strong>, 2019 put out bags, pickup food <strong>Saturday February 23</strong>, 2019. Please select your areas and let’s make this the biggest haul ever! <b>Bags are now available for pickup.</b> Please take only what you need. Each full box contains 1000 bags.</p>
<p>If your unit has not signed up to participate, ask why not! There are many areas which are not covered, and this represents food that can be collected. The public is willing to give, our job is to distribute and collect the bags. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-2019">More information and area maps.</a></p>
