 <p><strong>‚Äú2025 National Scouts BSA Fall Membership Kickoff‚Äù!</strong> Thursday, August 7, 2025 at 7pm Central on <a href="https://scouting-org.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_aWuUb60ITZWYsGsNo6XcMA#/registration"<strong>Zoom.</strong></a> It's that wonderful time of year to welcome new families into the fun and adventure of Scouting. While many events focus on Webelos crossing over into a troop, don't forget about the fall season.</p> 
		
<p> Come meet other Unit leaders, ask questions, network and learn from the topic of the month. We welcome all Adult volunteers. How do you know if you do not ask. Whether a new volunteer or lots of years in the saddle, it will be of value to you, to your unit and to our youth- its fun to network. Roundtable will begin the 2nd Thursday in August. First United Methodist Church Richardson, Rm. 230 @7:00 pm.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know who your Scout Unit Commissioner is? </strong>They are not the police, they are there to help and guide, to answer any questions you have about scouting. How can we help. If you do not know who your unit commissioner is, please contact <a href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com"><strong>bramfranklin@gmail.com</strong></a>

<p>Roundtable is starting back up for the fall. Please come and join in. The meetings are 2nd Thursday of every month at 7:00 pm at First United Methodist Church Richardson, Rm 230</p> 
<p>Roundtables are monthly meetings for Scouting leaders, held at the district level, and designed to provide supplemental training, program ideas, and fellowship.
