<h2>Sunday January 3, 2021</h2>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Happy New Year</strong></p>
<p>While 2020 is behind us, unfortunately some of the unique challenges are still with us and will continue for some time. In addition, there will be new challenges yet to face. As I said last week, the scouting program is designed to help equip scouts to face life challenges we know about and the ones yet to come. A scout is cheerful; a cheerful attitude will accomplish far more than lamenting how bad things are. A scout is helpful, and a willingness to step up and help, is a recipe for better results.</p>
<p>The new year is often a time to make resolutions. Let's resolve to meet the challenges head on and move forward. If your unit has been meeting rarely or worse yet has a delinquent charter, change that. Schedule a zoom meeting or a socially distanced event in a local park and talk about how to get your unit energized again. Review the recommendations and plan some safe events like campouts and meetings based on the best information available. Don't let the virus win! We need scouting skills more than ever.</p>
<p>Finally, it's no secret that many of us had financial impacts as a result of the pandemic, this has put severe strain on many. Circle Ten Council is feeling the effect as well. Please consider how your unit can help with the Friends of Scouting drive and the camp card program. We've lost some of the momentum and it's time to push a little harder and catch up. Even small amounts can make a difference. Scouting works, scouting matters.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter</strong></p>
<p>The charter year has drawn to a close, but if your unit has not re-chartered the time to do so is growing short. The bulk of the process can be done on-line, including payment, leaving only a small amount of paperwork to be turned in. By now every unit should have logged into the re-charter site. A tutorial on the re-charter process may be found <a href="https://i9peu1ikn3a16vg4e45rqi17-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Internet-Rechartering-Update_Version_12_October-1-2020.pdf">here</a>. Of course, you can always contact your unit commissioner for assistance. <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter_21_01_01.htm">Continue reading</a></p>
<p>These units have completed their re-charter; Packs: 435, 437, 473, 570, 751, 893, 894, 895, 1077, 2060, Troops: 81, 231, 231, 435, 444, 444, 570, 707, 751, 778, 890, 1077, 2021, 2054, and 2060.</p>

<p>These are challenging times and COVID has had a profound impact on all aspects of our lives. While COVID has disrupted many activities, the scouting program had continued and is adapting to the challenges. We must adapt again to ensure the health of the program by stepping up to the plate and doing our part to help fund council programs and facilities. To make the process a little easier, an on-line option is available <a href="https://tinyurl.com/NTFOS2021">here</a>.
