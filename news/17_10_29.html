<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Roundtable</strong> Thursday, November 9, 2017, 7:00PM FUMC</strong></p>
<p>Cub Scout Roundtable Den and Pack Behavior and Discipline. Now that we have recruited new scouts and our dens and packs have grown in number, how do we avoid the "herding cats" mentality? We want everyone to feel welcome and want to come back to our den and pack meetings while creating a fun and safe environment for the scouts. Meet other leaders to hear their success stories at our next Cub Scout Roundtable on Thursday, November 9th at 7PM at the First United Methodist Church of Richardson in the Education Building Room 227. Everyone is invited.

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable/Venturing Forum</strong> Tuesday, November 14, 2017, 7:00PM FUMC</strong></p>
<p>Lights - Action - Camera - Roll Tape! It's all about video production this month at your Boy Scout Roundtable. Everyone is invited whether you are in Cubs, Boys, Venturing, S.T.E.M., Sea Scouts, or Explorers. There will be viable information we can all use to teach our boys and girls video production and for Scouters to use video to help recruit new members. Your take away will be basic knowledge of how to produce a video on equipment you probably already have.</p>
<p>Our presenters are Hank Voegtle, director of our Video Contest, and Lloyd Watson, retired producer for ABC Television documentaries and ABC Sports. He has great knowledge and great stories to share and will give us pointers for doing our very own (hopefully award-winning) videos using our smartphone cameras and basic video editing programs.
