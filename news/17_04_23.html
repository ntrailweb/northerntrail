<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Getting Help</strong></p>

<p>Last week I touched on one of the most challenging problems, getting others to help with your unit. Getting in front of your group and making a blanket appeal rarely works very well. The best strategy is to identify specific quantifiable tasks you that need doing. Examples might be providing snacks for a court of honor or hosting a work session for pinewood derby cars. Open ended or poorly defined tasks are difficult to sell, because the volunteer just does not know what&rsquo;s involved and is fearful of failing to meet expectations. Once you have identified tasks, consider who might be well matched to each of them. Then make individual requests for help. If the answer is no, keep asking! Persistence pays off. If the person you ask can&rsquo;t help, then ask them to help recruit someone who can help. It&rsquo;s hard to both ask for help and in many cases let go of a task that you want to do yourself, but trying to do it all, is a recipe for poor results and burnout.</p>

<p>Not in a leadership position? Consider the fact that the ones who are leading your group need help, but may be hesitant to ask. Your help is needed and with more involvement your unit will be healthier and your scout will see that the program is important to you and is much more likely to continue in the program.</p>

<p>A good leader is always encouraging others to join in the fun thus enabling the success of others and allowing individuals to grow into leadership. &quot;Many Hands make light work&quot; &mdash; John Heywood</p>

<p>Twilight Camp would not be possible without parents and grandparents who volunteer to help with the event. These Walking Den Leaders attend camp and walk with the scouts from station to station. It&#39;s not difficult and it&#39;s fun. You only need to be present during camp each day from&nbsp;4pm until 8pm. If you can&#39;t come every day you can come part of the time. The challenge for the organizers is to have enough den leaders each day. Training, including Face to Face Youth Protection for walking den leaders, will be held in May. The dates are May 4, 18, and 25 from 7pm to 9 pm in Room 205 at First United Methodist Church in Richardson (503 N. Central Expressway, Richardson, TX 75080). All questions will be answered! Please bring your completed Medical forms A &amp; B to the training. You may also mail your completed forms to: <a href="mailto:registrar@ntrail.org">registrar@ntrail.org</a></p>
