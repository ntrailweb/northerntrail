<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Training</strong></p>
<p>We say over and over again that "Scouts Deserve Trained Leaders."  Training is essential to implement a safe and enjoyable program.  In addition to the primary goals, leaders who are trained can deliver the promise of scouting with less effort.  Training is a great way to understand scouting leadership roles before making the commitment to take on a leadership position. Send those parents who are resisting volunteering to training with no strings attached!  <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/why-training"><strong>More on why training.</strong></a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://circleten.org/youth-protection-training">Youth Protection Training</a></strong> This means you!</p>
<p>New more comprehensive training is now in place and unless you've taken the new course, your card is out of date!  We now have only one approved Youth Protection Certificate and everyone will have to have the <strong>new</strong>  card by <strong>October 1st.</strong> To protect not only our youth, but adult volunteers as well, this course has been updated to clearly define how we implement the program. Take the course at <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>.  Here are some <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/ypt-training-tips">YPT Training Tips</a> to make the process a little easier. Questions can be emailed to  <a href="mailto:571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org">571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org</a>. Don't wait until the last minute to get this done.  You won't be able to re-charter unless the adults in your unit have up-to-date training.  The whole process can be completed in about an hour.  Allocate the time now and get it out of the way!  <a href="http://circleten.org/youth-protection-training">More information</a></p>

<p><img align="right" hspace="5" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/snf_logo_0.png">
All indications are that this is going to be a great year for scout recruiting.  We have better access to the schools than ever before and we are now recruiting girls.  Adding girls to the mix will make it possible for many families to participate who found it difficult because of busy schedules. This makes it a true family activity and this is going to really help.  <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/school-night-scouting">Continue reading</a></strong></p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who attended the popcorn kickoff.</p> 
<p>If you missed the kickoff, please contact Tim McConville, District Popcorn Chair, at tmcconville@cmamanagement.com to register your unit and to arrange to get the needed materials.</p>
<p>The best source for up to date information and training tools is: <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/c/popcorn/feed">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/c/popcorn/feed</a>. </p>
<p>The next big date coming up is August 27th. This is the deadline for initial Show and Sell orders. </p>
<p>Popcorn sales is a great way for scouts in all divisions to earn money to cover unit dues, uniforms and summer camp expenses. The public believes in scouting and they want to help by purchasing popcorn. With just a little effort, scouts can earn money and help support the council at the same time. Attention Popcorn Kernels! The sale not only builds leadership and confidence but it allows a Scout to learn the value of earning their own way.</p>
