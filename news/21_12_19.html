<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Holiday Greetings</strong></p>
<p>Here is wishing everyone in Northern Trail a wonderful holiday season and a prosperous new year.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>We are have less than 2 weeks left before charters not yet completed will expire. Units with expired charters cannot participate in scouting activities.</p>

<p>Help is available, just ask!</p>

<p>Every unit’s charter expires on December 31. The recharter process is simpler than it has been in the past and by uploading documents and paying online, you can avoid a trip to a council office. The process even allows for the gathering of required signatures online. Let’s get started now and be 100% rechartered on January 1. For more help, contact you Unit Commissioner.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for the re-charter process you are still responsible to get your training up to date and any dues paid. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Youth Protection Training</span> is required for all adults and must be completed every two years.</p>
<p>Any questions or problems please contact your unit commissioner or Steve Bloberger who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:steve_bloberger@icloud.com">steve_bloberger@icloud.com</a></p>
<p>Here are some documents which may help:<br />

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Membership</strong> </p>
<p>Membership is a year-round activity. Don't jeopardize the future of your unit by failing to attract new members. Those who came before you made your unit possible. Consider the future scouts will benefit from their experience in scouting.</p>
<p>Please contact Bram Franklin <a href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com">bramfranklin@gmail.com</a>  if you can help with recruiting.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">New Explorer Post 500</strong> </p>
<p>Many of you may have heard of the Texans CAN Academies or their Cars for Kids program where you donate an old car and the proceeds go to supporting young people needing a second chance at a high school diploma. We are excited to share that Circle Ten Council has started a new partnership to deliver the Exploring program to these youth starting with their North Dallas Campus right here in Northern Trail District! For those not familiar with Exploring, it is a co-Ed 14-21 year old career exploration program of the BSA. It provides the same values of Scouting in a different delivery method by instilling young people with character, leadership and life skills. This particular Explorer Post will be focused on interfacing these young people who have dealt with difficult circumstances with careers they can succeed in and people who came from humble or troubled beginnings to be successful in their fields - starting with Circle Ten Council board members.</p>
<p>Please join us in welcoming Post 500 to the Scouting family and Northern Trail District! More info and opportunities to learn more coming soon. To learn more about Exploring, you can visit <a href="https://Exploring.org">Exploring.org</a> or contact our District Executive Katherine McCrary. <a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a></p>
