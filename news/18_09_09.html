<p>Come to Round table, Cub, Scout or Venturing - bring back valuable ideas and information which will help your unit. Every unit should send someone each month.</p>

<p>Are you a new or returning Cubmaster and need ideas and clues on how to run Pack meetings? Are you a new or returning den leader and need ideas on how to run den meetings? No worries! The solution is to attend Cub Scout Round Table.</p> 

<p>The Boy Scout Roundtable on Thursday, September 13th will feature guest speaker Grant Laughlin from Circle 10 Radio.  He will entertain us with his ham radio stories while giving us information on how the Scouts can earn their Radio Merit Badge and get their Ham Radio Licenses.  Jamboree on the Air (JOTA) is coming in October.  It's a great event where our Scouts get hands-on experience talking over the air to other radio operators around the world.  Mr. Laughlin will have plenty of information on how our Troop Leaders can show their Scouts a great and exciting day of fun, adventure, and awe.  Please join us.</p>  
<p>Venturing Round Table offers all sorts of ideas and plans for offering high adventure to the youth in Venturing.</p>
