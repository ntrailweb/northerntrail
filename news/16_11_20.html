<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Unit Inventory</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to those who have submitted their unit rosters.   Unfortunately, we are short rosters for several units.   The purpose of the roster submission is so we can check them against the official rosters at the council.  This is helpful in finding boys that the unit believes to be registered, but they are not.  Each unit should send their roster to Chad Caudle at <a href="mailto:Chad.caudle@scouting.org">Chad.caudle@scouting.org</a> as soon as possible.   A simple list of names of the scouts in your unit is all that is needed. Chad will check them against the official records and let the units know if there are any discrepancies.   <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-inventory">More information</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Get Started on your Re-Charter Today</strong></p>

<p>Every unit must re-charter each year.  On time re-charters are much easier than dealing with an expired charter.   Start early and it's not overwhelming, wait until the last minute and it's very hard on everyone!  Help is available, your unit commissioner can assist with the process.  If you are not directly responsible for the re-charter process you can help.  Every adult must have a current youth protection training card.   Everyone needs to pay their membership fees.  Don't wait, get started now!   <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/re-charter-checklist">Re-charter Checklist</a></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Your District Resource:  Unit Commissioners</strong></p>	
<p>Every Unit in Northern Trail has a district resource who is responsible for helping make you successful.  Regardless of need, the Unit Commissioners can facilitate a resolution.  Do you need an interpretation of the Guide to Safe Scouting?  Do you have a Scout in need of financial assistance in order to stay in Scouting?  How about help with your Recharter?  Regardless of the need, you have a Unit Commissioner at the other end of the phone who will jump into action.  Hopefully, that person has been touching base with you over the course of the year.   You can find out who your UC is on the Northern Trail web site at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners">northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners</a></p>

<p>If your unit is missing from the web page, or if you haven’t heard from your UC in a while, drop me a note and we will get that fixed.  If you have thoughts about becoming a Unit Commissioner and want to share your experience with other units, let me know and I can make that happen.  My contact information is Joe Tavares, District Commissioner for Northern Trail, <a href="mailto:tavares.joseph@gmail.com">tavares.joseph@gmail.com</a>, 214-675-4378.</p>
