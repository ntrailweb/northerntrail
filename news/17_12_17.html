<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Re-Charter Deadline</strong></p>
<p>If you are responsible for getting your unit's re-charter submitted, please complete this task as soon as possible. Don't wait a minute longer to get started. Help is available, contact Joe Tavares, <a href="mailto:tavares.joseph@gmail.com">tavares.joseph@gmail.com</a> and he will assist you.</p>
<p>If you are not directly responsible for re-charter, action on your part is still required. Make sure that you have paid your dues and that any required training or application forms have been submitted.</p>

<p>Rosters, please send a roster of your unit to our District Executive Chad Caudle, <a href="mailto:chad.caudle@scouting.org">chad.caudle@scouting.org</a>. Just a simple list of members. This helps cross check records and insures accuracy.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Youth Protection Training Deadline</strong></p>

<p>A priority in scouting is the safety of every participant, both youth and adult. To this end it is required that every adult who is registered, must complete a youth protection training session. Every registered adult must have a current youth protection card to complete the annual re-charter process. This required training is good for two years. Either the on-line or face-to-face training will meet this requirement. Online training is available here: <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a>. The training does not take very long and is not difficult.</p>
