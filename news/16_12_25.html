<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Scouting for Food</strong> Saturday February 11, 2017</p>

<p>Scouting for food is a great opportunity to demonstrate some of the values of the scout program. Food pantries in the area depend of the scouts to help restock their shelves after the holidays. Keep in mind that we have more areas to cover than we have scouts, so without your participation, available food won&#39;t be collected.  Get signed up and put it on your unit calendar.  More information and area maps <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-8">here.</a> Questions to Hunter Miller <a href="mailto:hmiller002.tx@gmail.com">hmiller002.tx@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>Save the Date You are invited to the birthday party for Scouts! January 12, 2016 the Cub Scout Round table will hold a birthday party! Of course, there will be cake!  7:00PM, FUMC RM211</p>  

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friends of Scouting &ndash; &ldquo;Unit Level&rdquo; Presenters Needed</strong></p>

<p>Many of the families in attendance at the various Courts of Honor &amp; Blue and Gold FOS presentations do not know anyone else involved in Scouting outside of their unit. Having a FOS unit level presenter provides someone that has instant familiarity and credibility within that unit. So, when they see you, they see someone representing both your unit, your district, and the council. Please present this opportunity at your next Committee meeting and provide the name/contact info of those interested to Brad Newberry. He will make sure you have a fully trained, friendly, recognizable face at your next Court of Honor or Blue and Gold FOS Presentation!
