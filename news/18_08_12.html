<p>Attention Popcorn Kernels! Please attend the Popcorn Kickoff on <b>Tuesday August 14, 2018</b> at 7PM at Lake Highlands Presbyterian Church, 8525 Audelia Rd, Dallas, TX 75238 <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LQUBXHvGdXP2">Map</a>. This kickoff will provide training as well all the materials your unit will need to begin your sale.</p>
<p>Scouting units run on popcorn...and hike and camp and swim, too. The sale not only builds leadership and confidence but it allows a Scout to learn the value of earning their own way. <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/c/popcorn/feed">More information.</a> Questions: Tim McConville, District Popcorn Chair <a href="mailto:tmcconville@cmamanagement.com">tmcconville@cmamanagement.com</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>School Night for Scouting</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" hspace="5" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/snf_logo_0.png">If you were at Roundtable last week, you know all about the upcoming School Night For Scouting. For those of you who missed it, there is good news! First of all, for the first time we can recruit <strong>girls</strong> into the program. Having girls in scouts is nothing new, the new thing is making the Cub Scout program available girls and in the new year to Scout units as well. Our world is changing and with busy young families, making the program available to both girls and boys will increase the number of adult volunteers and that is the key point. We have never been limited by lack of interest in young people, we have been limited by the number of adults who are able and willing to volunteer.</p>
<p>The other good news is that for the first time in many years, we have great access to the RISD schools and will hold rallies in every school in the district. Rather than a rally in the gym, our professional scouters will make the case to students in the classrooms. These kids are going to be pumped! We need your help to tap into that energy at the evening events at the schools and meet the parents and sign up these new scouters. Training, materials and help will be available to help units with School Night.</p>
<p>In addition to the school night, most of the schools will allow us to come on the "meet the teacher" night and set up a table and answer questions that parents and students will have about scouting.</p>
<p>The schedule may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/school-night-scouting-schedule">here.</a></p>
<p>Watch the newsletter and website for updates. Plan on participating and helping grow scouting in our district. Our goal is to recruit 600 new scouts! Make your plans to participate known to our District Executive Jack Carpenter, <a href="mailto:Jack.Carpenter@scouting.org">Jack.Carpenter@scouting.org</a>, (214)902-6743. He will arrange to get materials and information to you. If you have questions, contact your unit commissioner or the District Executive.</p>

<p>New more comprehensive training is now in place and unless you've taken the new course, your card is out of date! We now have only one approved Youth Protection Certificate and everyone will have to have the <strong>new</strong> card by <strong>October 1st.</strong> To protect not only our youth, but adult volunteers as well, this course has been updated to clearly define how we implement the program. Take the course at <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. Here are some <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/ypt-training-tips">YPT Training Tips</a> to make the process a little easier. Questions can be emailed to <a href="mailto:571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org">571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org</a>. Don't wait until the last minute to get this done. You won't be able to re-charter unless the adults in your unit have up-to-date training. The whole process can be completed in about an hour. Allocate the time now and get it out of the way!</p>
