The Wilderness First Aid (WFA) Training is a 16-hour, hands-on course to give adult leaders the experience needed to handle illness and injury when medical care is more than an hour away. When paired with CPR/AED certifications, leaders are well prepared to deal with emergencies and routine medical issues that may occur on an outdoor adventure.</p>
<p>All four of the BSA high-adventure bases (HAB) require at least one person per trek (two per trek at Philmont Scout Ranch) to be current in WFA. Of course, having more participants trained in WFA skills is highly recommended for any high adventure or backcountry experience.

</p><ul>

<li>Reaching out to your employer for corporate matching funds</li>
<li>Volunteering to help with our fundraising efforts through networking</li>
<li>Inviting one of our FOS speakers to your next Scouting event such as a Blue & Gold or Court of Honor</li>
<li>Establishing a connection between Vaughn Dubose or Trey Otte and one or more of your Unit’s “Key Three” leaders.</li>
</ul>
<p>***If your pack or troop is only holding virtual events, we would love a chance to speak during one of your online meetings this spring. 
Please reach out to Vaughn Dubose, FOS Family Chairperson, at vaughndubose@gmail.com or Trey Otte, 2021 Friends of Scouting Chairperson, at trey@otte.us if you are able to help in any way. Thank you so much.
