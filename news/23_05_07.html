		<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Eagle Scout Recognition</p>
<img src="https://ntrail.org/images/eagle.png" align="right" style="float:right; width: 10%;">
		<p>Did you know you can get your Eagle Scout's accomplishment in the Dallas Morning News? While the GSA submits names through their organization, Eagle Scout information comes from the families. Submit your Eagle Scout's information (after their regalia comes and they have their official certificate) to <a href="mailto:scouts@ahbelo.com"><strong>scouts@ahbelo.com</strong></a>.</p>
		<p>The DMN needs the scout's name, age and birth date, troop number, school and grade, a brief description of their project, parent's names, a mailing address, day and evening phone numbers, and a non-returnable photo.</p>
 <p>Generally the DMN publishes 3 Eagles and 3 Gold Awards every week so be complete with your information so you have a chance to see your scout's name in the newspaper. About once a year, the paper has a "catch up" day and generally posts a full page of award recipients.</p>
		<p>If you have questions, contact Joe Tavares <a href="mailto:tavares.joseph@gmail.com"><strong>tavares.joseph@gmail.com</strong></a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/Download/571109498/OR/2023_NT_Twilight_Camp_Flyer.pdf"><strong>Twilight Camp Details!</strong></a></p> 
<p>Parents of Cub Scouts: Don’t miss out on Twilight Camp on June 5-9! <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023NTTwilightCamp"><strong>Register!</strong>.</a> We are Off To The Races! This year the program is upgraded to give your scouts an all-new experience with their favorite activities and advancement, including the NOVA Stem award for Webelos and Arrow of Light ranks. On Friday night at the end of camp we will have a Webelos campfire with Order of the Arrow Scouts. So grab your swaps and we are off to the races!</p>
<p>Walking Den Leaders are the reason that our cub scouts safely have a blast at camp. We would love for every parent of a cub scout in camp to enjoy twilight camp with them.</p>
<p>Any adult that plans to be in camp, even for a day, must to be registered in advance. The state of Texas requires that any adults interacting with kids in camp have certain background checks in place before camp starts. This protects all our kids. This year you may notice that we are asking for an Adult in Camp State Compliance form (<a href="https://scoutingevent.com/Download/57144265/OR/Adult_in_Camp_State_Compliance.pdf"><strong>.../Adult_in_Camp_State_Compliance.pdf</strong></a>)</p>
<p> in addition to the usual YPT Training and medical forms part A & B (<a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/HealthSafety/pdf/680-001_AB.pdf"><strong>.../HealthSafety/pdf/680-001_AB.pdf</strong></a>). These forms put us in compliance with new state safety regulations for day camps.</p>
<p>We are getting excited to be off to the races with you and your Cub Scouts. 
More details may be found in the <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/Guide_for_Parents_Leaders.pdf"><strong>leaders guide.</strong></a></p>
 
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Update on National BSA Camping Guidelines</p>
<ul>
<li>Please click link to see upcoming Adult Leader Camping requirements, effective on September 1st, 2023. Packs- please note the overnight programs exception. <a href="https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/gss01/"><strong>https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/gss01/</strong></a> </li>
<li>Nationals has made a clarifying statement that “Cub Scout packs are only allowed to camp for one night.” However, Circle Ten is making an accommodation to our cub scout units, and will allow packs to participate in weekend campouts (1+) at our 4 in-council camps.</li>
