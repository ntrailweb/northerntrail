<a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content/twilight-camp-t-shirt-pickup-0">Twilight Camp T-Shirts</a> -- The shirts have arrived and are ready to distribute. 
Two opportunities to pick up shirts:
<ul><li>Wednesday June 5th from 11:30 AM to 9PM in the Founder's Hall.</li>
<li>Thursday, June 6th from 7PM to 9PM in the Parish Life Center</li>
</ul>
Episcopal Church of the Epiphany is located Richardson at 421 Custer Rd (between Arapaho and Beltline.

Please send one person from the pack to pick up the T-Shirts and then distribute them to those who are coming to Twilight Camp. Paperwork and money can be dropped off at this time as well. If your pack is unable to attend one of these days, please contact Barbara Richer to make arrangements to pick up the shirts prior to camp.

The pack coordinator may call me at 214-478-3972 and arrange to pick them up earlier (or later if you have to)

<a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=twilight">Twilight Camp Information</a> -- Twilight Camp Walking Den Leader information packet is available on the website. Don't forget you will need <a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content/face-to-face">Face-to-Face Youth Protection Training</a>. </td></tr>


<tr><td><a href="">Still need Face to Face YPT?</a> -- There is one remaining Face to Face Youth Protection Training session that is on the Tuesday night of Twilight Camp so it is perfect for Tiger Parents since they don't come to camp until Wednesday.<br /><br />

You can register for the training <a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content%2Fface-face-youth-protection-6">here</a> so they know how many to expect. The training will be held on Tuesday, June 11th at 7:30 at First United Methodist Church of Richardson, 503 North Central Expressway, in the Bartula Family Life Center building.<br /><br />

Please bring a copy of your card to camp (or bring the card itself if you don't have a copy) since I will not be at this training session to make a copy of the cards like I normally do.
