<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">It's Hot Out There</p>
<img src="http://ntrail.org/images/sun.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; max-width:25%">
<p>There is no doubt that this has been an unusually hot July and August and we have all been trying to beat the heat.  Hydration is critical.  For some reason, it can be difficult to consume enough fluid to replace what is lost. It’s critical to be proactive about your water intake in very hot weather.  Make sure everyone in your party has adequate water and is consuming enough to stay hydrated.  Don’t assume!  Teach your scouts to be aware of the color of their urine.  Copious and clear is the key to staying properly hydrated.</p>
<p>Heat exhaustion occurs when your body is no longer able to cool itself via perspiration.   Like your car, if the warning light comes on, the time to act is now.  Waiting will lead to much more serious problems.  The next step is heat stroke.  Victims of heat stroke will have elevated body temperature and will often start to stammer and be delirious.  It can be very difficult to help someone in such a state. Get the person to cool place as soon as possible and get medical attention.</p>
