		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Plan Your Scouting Year Now</strong></p>

		<p>Advanced planning is the key to a great scouting program. Make it a part of every committee meeting to review the calendar for the upcoming year and make sure you have plans in place for meetings, campouts, fundrasing, activities, training and summer camps. Your calendar and annual plan should be a living document. With scout and venturing units, this planning job is the basic responsibility of the scouts, but as scout leaders it is often necessary to nudge, remind, suggest, advise and prod your scouts into action. Your plans don't have to be precise, define what you are going to do, then determine when, who and finally the details of the events. Don't let the lack of information lull you into putting off any planning. Go with what you know and flesh out the details as you can. Good, advanced planning will increase participation, reduce stress on everyone and increase the chances of a really great program. </p>
 
 
 
 			<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Round Table - Program Preview</strong></p>
			<p>Round table is for all scout parents and leaders. This Round Table will feature a preview of coming events for the balance of the scouting year and next year. Learn about the various activities, resources and training opportunities available to make your scouting experience the best that it can be.</p>

			<li><strong>Wilderness First Aid</strong> Wilderness First Aid, a 16-hour class required for all High Adventures Treks, a minimum of two for Philmont and one for the others.

I have the following classes scheduled: May 4-7</strong> at Trinity Bible Church, 400 Campbell Rd, Richardson. The cost is $85. Fri night, 6:30-10:30 pm; Sat 8 am - 4:30 pm; and Sun 12:30-4:30 pm CPR/AED is required and offered the Thursday before is class, at a cost of $40.

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Camporee Roundup</strong></p>
 <p>This year's Camporee "Camping is In Tents" was a great deal of fun for all who attended. Northern Trail combined forces with six other districts to have an action packed event with more than 1,000 attendees. The day was filled with patrol competitions and events including pancake toss, canoe races, fire building, first aid, and the climbing tower. Of course no camporee would be complete without shooting sports that included archery, shotgun, and tomahawk range. Many thanks to the many Arapaho Chapter members who staffed various areas and organized all the Order of the Arrow ceremonies, First Aid station and Lashing station. Highlight of the evening was the campwide campfire and award ceremony capped by the Order of the Arrow callout.</p>
