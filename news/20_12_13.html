<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA troops, Venturing Crews and Sea Scout Ships. It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.
Units camp jamboree style with multiple units in a single campsite. The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards. Food is prepared by each unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ).</p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Keep Calm and CAMP On</strong></p>
<p>The weather is great, and the camps are open, it's time to get out there and enjoy them. The COVID safety protocols have been proven and are in place to ensure a safe activity. <strong><a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55913/keep-calm-and-camp-on-unit-camping">Sign-up for a camp site and view the guidelines!</a></strong></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Circle Ten COVID-19 Guidelines</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/54581/circle-ten-council-guidelines-related-to-covid-19">Here</a> is a summary of the guidelines provided by the council. </p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Camp Cards</strong></p>
<p>Camp cards: Fundraiser designed to help units fund their way to camp programs with a risk-free unit sales project. Camp cards are easy to sell and help raise money for your scouts to attend camp and support the council. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://az601583.vo.msecnd.net/app-content/posts/10616/2020/12/04/circleten_06_14_10_0510.pdf">form</a> to commit your unit to the sale. Save the form to your computer, fill in out and save it to your computer. Send the completed form to: <a href="mailto:nathan.doherty@scouting.org">nathan.doherty@scouting.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection Training is Required</strong></p>
<p>This is not optional. If you don't have a current card, you cannot participate in any scouting activity virtual or in-person. Lack of current YPT training will stymie your unit re-charter. No charter, no unit, no advancement. Please don't delay get this done. It only takes about an hour to complete. Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> If you have trouble making it work speak up. We will not let you fail.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Membership Renewal</strong></p></strong></p>
<p>If you are a member of the district committee or a commissioner, please send in your renewal ASAP. The fee this year is $42. For most all that is needed is a check, however if in doubt, please send in the completed <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/524-501.pdf">application</a> and signed authorization for the background check. Don't forget, you must have a current YPT card. If you have any questions, please contact our district executive: Rachel Joslyn <a href="mailto:Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org">Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org</a><br />

<p>National Youth Leadership Training in 2021. First course will be during spring break: Match 3-19, 2021. NYLT is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home troops and in other situations demanding leadership of self and others.</p>
<p>The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO. The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership. Registration opens December 31,2020. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT?fbclid=IwAR26pr2ekIzf4lG2_UM3gFYfxK0hqur9e91U5qXU2WdWyTUdTpzW3Qj_eSk">More information.</a></p>
