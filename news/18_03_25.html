This is in <b>ADDITION</b> to Face-to-Face training which is still required for day camp, summer camp and winter camp.</p>

By October 1, 2018, all new and currently registered leaders will be required to complete the updated training. Please see the <a href="http://circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/new_ypt2_update_quick_facts.pdf">Quick Facts</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>The new updated online Youth Protection Training does not replace the current Face-to-Face Youth Protection Training to be compliant with Title 25, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 265, Subchapter B, Texas Youth Camps Safety and Health.<br />
If you have any questions please contact: <br />
Circle Ten Council Program Director, Karen Thunert<br /> 
Circle Ten Council YPT Champion, Kresha Alvarado</p>
<p>This does not replace F2F, but is in <span style="font-weight:bold;">addition</span> to F2F if that is the only training you receive for YPT. As you know, F2F is required for any long-term camp (more than 72 hours).</p>
<p>In addition, Adult Volunteers now must have this YPT, along with the other Leader-Specific Training for their role in order to qualify for the Trained designation.</p>

<p>Camp Card sales for Tom Thumb/Albertson start soon. Please make sure you are signed up to sell at booth sales, but do not forget the good old fashion of selling via your network of family, friends, neighbors, and scout leaders. Make sure that every time a scout sells 25 cards, they are entered into the weekly drawing. Each 25 gets a new entrance. Good Luck and keep selling! May 11th is last day to turn in money and unsold camp cards to the scout offices.<br />Deborah DiStasi, <a href="mailto:deborahdistasi@gmail.com">deborahdistasi@gmail.com</a>, 972-644-4225
