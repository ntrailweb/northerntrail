<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable, Tuesday, January 9, 2018</strong></p>
<p>Retention: First, there is recruiting then comes retention. It's a never-ending battle faced by corporations, universities, and yes even by Boy Scouts leaders. Our topic at your January Boy Scout Roundtable is "All About Retention."</p>
<p>Bring your ideas and your tricks-of-the-trade to share with other Troops. Come ready to get new ideas for honing your retention skills, or just to learn about it for the first time. Everyone is invited and welcome. We have a seat saved for you.</p><p>At Roundtable, it's about our organization competing against other organizations rather than my troop competing with your troop. Attending strengthens us. Tuesday, January 9th. First United Methodist Church of Richardson, <a href="http://www.fumcr.com/campus_floor-plans">2nd floor Education Building</a>. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vYSKTy2LfyR2">503 N Central Expy</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Roundtable, Thursday, January 11, 2018</strong></p><p>It's Racing Season! Racing in a Cub Scout derby is great fun. Each
Scout gets to design a racing vehicle, work with a parent or
other adult to build it, and see it perform on race day. Win
or lose, Scouts can take pride in having done their best.
Participants learn craft skills, the rules of fair play, and good
sportsmanshipâ€”things they will remember all their lives. We will have a Pinewood Derby expert as our guest speaker. Come learn some techniques on how to run a successful Derby for your pack.</p>
