<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Scouting is a Unique Activity</strong></p>
<p>Today there are more opportunities than ever to occupy the time of our children. Many see scouting as just another in a list of items like sports, band, and other school related activities to choose from. In truth scouting is compatible with all these activities. My own children as do many others, did all the above, including scouting.</p>
<p>One of themes which I have stressed over the years is that scouting is not about entertainment. Yes, scouting is designed to be fun, however as the training clearly states, the fun is the “hook” which captures the attention of our children.</p>
<p>Wrapped around the fun are the aims and methods of scouting. The aims are fundamentally quite simple, character development, leadership development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. All of these are embodied in the scout oath and law.</p>
<p>So yes, while our children will benefit from these other activities, scouting offers more, much more. 
If you recognize the benefit of scouting and demonstrate that it is important by your active participation, your children are much more likely to see the value of scouting and want to continue participating.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Den Chief Training, August 4, 2021</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; width:30%;" hspace="5" src="https://ntrail.org/images/den_chief_patch.png"> Den chief is a Scout or Venture Scout who assists a Cub Scout den leader, Webelos den leader or Arrow of Light den leader with den meetings and activities​.</p>
<p>This training will be held on Wednesday August 4, 2021 at First United Methodist Church from 6pm to 8:30pm. Fee is $15 which includes the Den Chief handbook. Signup on <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NTDenChiefTraining?draftmode=1">BlackPug</a></p>
