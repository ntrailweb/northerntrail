<h3>Why Scouting</h3>

<table class="main" width=700> 

<tr><td>
On more than one occasion a parent has said to me, "my son decided that he did not want to go to camp, so we are not going to participate..." My usual response is that scouting is not about "entertainment" but rather the <strong>"Aims"</strong>, which are character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Summer camps, rank advancement and the like are some of the methods of scouting. The goal is to create a fun program that our youth will enjoy participating in, but the reason we do this is to achieve the <strong>"Aims"</strong> of scouting. As parents we must recognize that many times we really need to encourage participation, even when our children don't immediately recognize the value of the activity. I've yet to meet an adult who wished that they had "not" participated in scouting.<br />

<p>So next time when your scout pushes back on an upcoming activity or event, remember the <strong>"Aims"</strong> and do a better job of selling the "FUN." These activities are always fun and your scout likely does not know what he is missing! Your scout will look back years later and thank you for your persistence!

<h3>Twilight Camp is a Wrap</h3>

<table class="main" width=700> 

<tr><td>
The Northern Trail District Committee and Commissioner Staff would like to send out a big "Thank You!" to all Walking Den Leaders, Junior Staff and Senior Staff for making this year's 2013 Northern Trail District Twilight Camp a great success! Over 400 children from Northern Trail and surrounding Districts enjoyed beautiful weather and a great program all week out at Breckinridge Park, and it was all thanks to your service. Special Thanks to this year's key volunteers: Camp Director Paul Horlick, Program Director Lalita Howell (who took this past week out of her busy schedule to help us out as she makes her way to Blackland Prairie District's Twilight Camp this upcoming week for the same role) and Registrar extraordinaire Barbara Richer. <br /><br />

 If you did not participate this year be sure and mark your calender and plan to attend next year. June 9th through June 14th, 2014
