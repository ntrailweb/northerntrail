<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Why the BSA</strong></p>
<p>Editor's note, John McCollum wrote a blog entry for the old website and he has updated it. It was a great read then and is even better now!</p>

<p>(2018 update: I now believe that the Values, Vision, and Mission of Lord BP should, and do apply to young ladies as well as young men. -JMcC)</p>

<p>John Slaughter has done a fantastic job in his recent blogs in trying to describe the WHAT, the HOW and the WHY of the Boy Scout program. I especially agree with him that the WHY is perhaps the most elusive. Undoubtedly, it is the most difficult to describe, especially to the modern parents who may be ill-informed and believe that the Scouting program is simply a camping club that teaches outdoor skills such as fire building and knot tying. Neither of which is needed nor particularly useful in our modern technical society.</p>

<p>Here’s my take on WHY I’m still a believer in the program. It all starts with the program founder, Lord Baden-Powell. (Several of these concepts are taken directly from the Wood Badge curricula, while others are my own extrapolation from reading the writings of BP and observing the workings of the program.) <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/why-bsa">Continue reading</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://circleten.org/youth-protection-training-update">Youth Protection Training</a></strong></p>
<p>We now have only one approved Youth Protection Certificate and everyone will have to have the <strong>new</strong> card by October 1st. To protect not only our youth, but adult volunteers as well, this course has been updated to clearly define how we implement the program. For Summer camp this year, a valid Face-to-Face YPT card will be acceptable, but will be invalid after <strong>October 1st 2018.</strong> If you need an approved card for Summer Camp, take the course at <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. Here are some <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/ypt-training-tips">YPT Training Tips</a> to make the process a little easier. </p>
<p>Now is a great time to get needed training completed and out of the way. Hazardous Weather Training is required for front line leaders. There are a world of on-line training courses available on <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. A great example is the driving safety course. Even with more than fifty years of driving, I learned a few good tips watching this class. Remember you can't re-charter your unit unless every adult has the undated YPT training certificate. Avoid the rush, get it done now. <p>Questions can be emailed to <a href="mailto:571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org">571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><img align="right" src="">Hazardous Weather Training</strong></p>
<p>Scouting is committed to safety and weather safety is of particular importance in our area. Effective <strong>April 30th, 2018</strong>, new direct contact leaders must complete Hazardous Weather Training to be considered position trained. This includes, Cubmasters, Den Leader
Webelos Den Leaders, Scoutmasters, LDS leaders of 11-year olds, Crew Advisors, Ship Skippers and Post Advisors. This program has a two year expiration.</p>
<p>This is the NEW training, numbered SCO_800. You will no longer be considered Trained if you have not completed this training before May 1. It is also a requirement for all camp staff as part of the NCAP standards SQ-402.</p>
<p>To take the course go to <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a> and log-in to your account. Create an account if you don’t already have one.</p>
<p>Click on the "BSA LEARN CENTER" icon to reach the training site. Under "EXPANDED LEARNING" click on "PROGRAM SAFETY." Click on "Program Safety" and then select "Hazardous Weather Training."</p>

<p>Scouting units run on popcorn...and hike and camp and swim, too. The sale not only builds leadership and confidence but it allows a Scout to learn the value of earning their own way.</p>

<p><img align="left" hspace="10" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/ww_2018_small.png">Here is a great opportunity to get help up and coming Boy Scouts get a great launch into the Boy Scout program. Troops are needed to help staff this event. If you are interested in staffing, please attend the planning meeting in FUMC-R, room 225, 7-8:30 pm May 16, June 20, July 25, Aug. 15 and Sept. 12.
The theme for Webelos Woods is “Scout Skills”. Scout Troops are encouraged to volunteer for STAFF in the following areas: Compass, First Aid (making kits), Knife & Axe (safe use and cleaning), Dutch Oven Cooking, First Aid bandage ( using neckerchief), Tug- a-war, String Burning, Campsite inspections, and other events TBD. Remember the idea is to have experienced scouts STAFF these areas and not Adults. 
Cost for event has been set at $10.00 for Cub and Cub Adult.
Cubs and Scout Troops provide their own food.
