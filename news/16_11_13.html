<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Chris Miller (1971-2016)</strong></p>
<p>We are sad to report the passing of Vigil Brother Chris Miller, after a lengthy battle with diabetes and its complications. Chris was a long time member of our Chapter serving as an Associate Adviser for 5 years. As a youth, Chris had been the Chapter Chief of Yanush (before it became Arapaho). Chris could be found at many of our chapter meetings, district events and lodge functions, helping behind the scenes, as a model of Cheerful Service. He will be sorely missed. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/chris-miller-1971-2016">More information</a>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Unit Inventory</strong></p>

<p>Each year we do membership inventories.  We request the units send their unit rosters of active youth so that we can check them against the official rosters at the council.  This is helpful in finding boys that the unit believes to be registered, but they  are not.  Please ask that each unit send their rosters to Chad Caudle at <a href="mailto:Chad.caudle@scouting.org">Chad.caudle@scouting.org</a> by Nov 18th.  Chad will check them against the official records and let the units know if there are any discrepancies.   <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-inventory">More information</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong></p>

<p>The deadlines for Adult Recognition nominations are rapidly approaching.    Y.E.S.-Your Extraordinary Service Award, The District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award.   Deadline Dec 1, 2016.</p>

<p>The Silver Beaver is a the highest council award for scouters. The deadline is Nov 28, 2016.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Get Started on your Re-Charter Today</strong></p>

<p>Every unit must re-charter each year.  On time re-charters are much easier than dealing with an expired charter.   Start early and it's not overwhelming, wait until the last minute and it's very hard on everyone!  Help is available, your unit commissioner can assist with the process.  If you are not directly responsible for the re-charter process you can help.  Every adult must have a current youth protection training card.   Everyone needs to pay their membership fees.  Don't wait, get started now!   <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/re-charter-checklist">Re-charter Checklist</a></strong></p>

<p>November 15th, 7:00 to 9:00 PM you are invited to take face-to-face Youth Protection Training (F2F YPT) at Spring Creek Elementary. It could not be more convenient! This training is REQUIRED for adults who will participate in overnight scouting events that are 3 or more nights long. It is also HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all adults who participate in scouting events or weekend campouts. Yes, you can take YPT online, but that will not meet all of the requirements, so bottom line is that this face-to-face session will satisfy ALL YPT requirements for TWO YEARS.  <a href="ttp://northerntrail.circleten.org/event-youth-protection-training-adults-f2f-ypt">More information</a>   </p>
