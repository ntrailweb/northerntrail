<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection Training is Required</strong></p>
<p>No excuses, get it done today.  You can't be a part of the program without a current card. Please take the time now to get current.  Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter, Time to Get Cracking</strong></p>
<p>Every unit should have logged in by now.  We are still seeing units which have not started the process.  Waiting until the last minute is a recipe for pain, not only for unit leaders, but unit commissioners, our district executive and the hard working folks at the council office.  Help avoid the pain, get started today.</p>
<p>A big stumbling block will be confirming that every adult on your roster has a current Youth Protection Training. Youth Protection Training is good for two years.  This is a showstopper so you must get this done as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>There is a re-charter clinic on Wednesday November 4th at 6:00PM on Zoom. Bring your questions.<br />

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable Trunk or Treat?</strong></p>
<p>No, not a late Halloween event, our November Roundtable will feature our “Cooking with Northern Trail Thanksgiving Special.” We will be setting up in person and online on Thursday, November 12 in the west parking lot (across Custer Road) of First United Methodist Church Richardson for a practical demonstration of making a traditional Thanksgiving dinner using Dutch oven cookery. This Roundtable special event is for all adult leaders-Cub Scouts, Scouts BSA, Venturing and Sea Scouts.</p>
<p>So, join us on November 12 at 7:30 P.M. and learn some Dutch oven cooking tricks, enjoy fellowship with other Scouters and maybe get some samples.</p>
<p>Yours in Scouting,<br />

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership is a Year Round Activity</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" hspace="5" src="https://ntrail.org/images/join_cub_scouts.jpg">We, as Scouts BSA, need boys and girls as the recipients of teaching, coaching & mentoring our shared goals of character, ethics, leadership & fun.  We need your help increasing our membership base. Our Northern Trail membership committee will be reaching out to every pack, troop, crew, ship & post to speak to your committee membership lead.  If you do not have that volunteer in place on your team, please create one, it just takes asking. We will be asking them to be part of the Northern Trail membership team to help with recruitment, marketing ideas, and general N/T improvements to each team and our overall membership.  </p>
<p>Every Scouting family should have a <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">yard sign</a>, either Cub Specific or generic. Yard signs will demonstrate that Scouting is thriving in Northern Trail.</p>
