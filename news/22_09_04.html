<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Why Scouting</strong></p>
<p><i>(Editors note, this is a repeat of an article written by John McCollum in 2014 about the What, Why and How of scouting.)</i></p>
<p>As a long-time Scouter, still active long after my son finished the program, I understand the question of WHY am I still active in the Boy Scouts of America.  So, amid all the perceived ‘issues’ with the BSA and now with the new program referred to as Scouts BSA, I have recently taken a pause to seriously consider my motivation for continuing to participate and/or support the organization. <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/news/why_scouting.htm">Continue reading.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">School Night For Scouting</strong> </p>
<p>School nights for scouting are in full swing it is vital that your unit participates. Be sure make these new scouts and their parents feel welcome in your unit. With new scouts come new parents and new parents have enthusiasm, skills, and energy to help your unit thrive.</p>
<p>Please contact Katherine McCrary	<a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a> if you can help with school night for scouting or have questions.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>Now is the time to get signed up for training. Unit leaders, send new parents to training.</p>
<p>Youth Protection Training (YPT) is only valid for two years.  Every adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete this required task. On-line at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>.</p>  
<p>In addition to YPT, every leader must be position trained.  There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTFallLST">Leader Specific Training (LST)</a> is coming up Saturday October 8th and is for Scouts BSA leaders and parents. Sign up on-line. This is a two part course and the outdoor part, <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTiols">Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills (ILST)</a> is the weekend of October 21-23. There are separate sign-ups for both. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTBALOO">Basic Adult  Outdoor Orientation (BALOO)</a> for Cub Scout Leaders is the weekend of October 21-23.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Webelos Woods, November 4-6, 2022</strong></p>
<p>Webelos Woods is an awesome opportunity for Webelos (and their parents) to experience some of the fun that they can look forward to once they cross over into a troop. Troops will host Webelos Scouts from various packs and will form patrols which will include those Webelos Scouts for the weekend. Packs will be assigned to camp with a host Troop by the event staff.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the patrols will rotate in a round-robin style of activities where they can visit with different Troops. Each patrol will learn a variety of different outdoor and Scout skills and put them to use in live demonstrations. On Saturday night, both districts will come together to enjoy a rousing campfire program with yells and skits! There will also be a OA Brotherhood ceremony on Saturday evening.</p>
<p><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022IronHorseWebelosWoods"><strong>Register today</strong></a>, early bird discount until 10/9/22. Limited space.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. It will be here before you know it!</p>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone. If you are not in charge of re-charter, take the time to do your part by completing any required training, submitting applications and paying your dues.</p>
