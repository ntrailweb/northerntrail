<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Training</strong></p>
<p><strong>Caution,</strong> for about half of Northern Trail scouters, their Youth Protection Certificates is two years old and has or will expire soon. To take the course visit <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org</a>. Many Northern Trail unit Scoutmasters, Cubmasters and Den leaders are not position trained. Training is required for these positions and will make your job as a leader easier. In addition be sure and take advantage of the wealth of other training resources. Hazardous Weather Training, Safety afloat. Merit Badge counselor and troop committee training. <a href="https://my.scouting.org/Documents/PositionTrainedCourses.pdf">Here</a> is a chart which explains the training requirements for each scouting position. </p>
<a id="re"></a>
<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Religious Emblem</strong></p>
<p>Have your Cub Scouts, ScoutsBSA members or Venturers earned the Religious Emblem for their faith? The first duty that a Scout recites in the Scout Oath is to do one’s duty to God. The last part of the Scout Law is that “a Scout is Reverent.” In nearly every rank in scouting, a youth is required to demonstrate how they have demonstrated reverence to God. One way to do this is by earning the Religious Emblem for their faith. These awards are offered through the youth’s faith, but are approved for wear on their uniform-either the award itself of the silver on purple square knot. Summer is a perfect time for youth to start working on these awards, the pressures of school are gone.</p>
<p>So how do your youth earn these awards. The first step is for the unit to have a Religious Emblems Coordinator (REC). What is a REC? The Unit Religious Emblems Coordinator strengthens units by educating, motivating, evaluating, and facilitating the religious emblems program at the unit level. In addition to serving on the unit committee, a key function of the position is to serve as the liaison to the District Religious Emblems Coordinator. Of course there is a patch to accompany the position.
For more information please contact Hank Voegtle, Chair of the Circle Ten Religious Relationships Committee, at 214-769-5040 (voice or text) or at <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com">hjv3@outlook.com</a></p>

<a id="tc"></a>
<p>While we have been unable to hold Twilight Camp as scheduled this year, there are still the one day council-wide camp experiences at Camp Wisdom starting June 16. Every Cub Scout deserves an outstanding experience, and combining Twilight Camp experiences with the facilities of Cub World should be fantastic! It should be fantastic if there is staff for the event. Your help is needed and sign-up is easy, <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/9040F44ACA62CA2FE3-atcamp"> Sign up here</a>. </p>
<p>The dates for the “at Camp experience” at Camp Wisdom are June 16, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, and August 8 and 29.<br />
The dates for the “at Camp experience” at Camp James Ray are August 1 and 22.</p>
<p>Want to be in a smaller group, work fewer hours and get lunch? “People are also needed to help with cleaning from 10 A.M. to Noon, with lunch provided at Camp Wisdom on June 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29.”</p>

<p>The Camp Experience "at home" is now in progress and activities can be downloaded at <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/54130/handpickedfun">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/54130/handpickedfun</a>. The general idea is for you and your Cub Scout to spend 2 hours/day for 5 days creating and enjoying your own "at-Home" Cub Scout Day Camp. No, you don't have to do 5 days in a row! Do it when it works for your family and/or use the guide all summer long!</p>

<p>All BSA High Adventures bases plan to operate in some way this summer. All have made changes and as each one says there will be more changes needed as new information/data becomes available. Each base on their website will have update on the 1st and 15th of each month. In general, they would like to work only with only the lead advisor/continent leader via email/telephone to cut down on the number of people with whom they are communicating. Northern Tier did give out a special contact number for 972-350-3502 On the Northern Tier website there is a hot link to a video from Al Lambert, National director of Outdoor Adventure and the National High Adventure Base General Managers. <a href="https://zoom.us/rec/play/v8F4JuyvqDs3S4GT4gSDBvd4W9S-fKis1ilKrqcJyE6yUSULYVShYrcSZLQdAvqI-jBi2Ow4iuoQ6tWG?startTime=1588347441000&_x_zm_rtaid=m-7kTcF6SIqzbnL2YR5_jg.1588536866797.7624a82b6ad6b7d1b0e6a0150fef324f&_x_zm_rhtaid=580">Link to video.</a></p>

<p>WFA/CPR/AED certification<br />
Philmont, Northern Tier, Summit - would like for the crew to have the current required certificates but will not deny any crew from having a high adventure experience this summer. Currently they say there is no on-line class that meets the requirements.</p>
<p>Sea Base - from their website:<br />
"Wilderness First Aid Expired Certifications Sea Base will accept WFA certifications that have been “extended” by the training agency. The individual must meet all requirements of the extension. CPR Several approved CPR training agencies have begun offering online courses including American Red Cross (ARC)."</p>
<p>To my knowledge the on-line CPR/AED courses require hands-on demonstration of CPR/AED with a certified instructor.</p>
<p>With the present distancing and number of people allowed together at one location rules, it is not possible to offer a WFA or CPR/AED class.</p>
<p>Be flexible and hopefully everyone can have a high adventure experience this summer.</p>

<a id="mb"></a>
<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Merit Badges from Home</strong></p>
<p>At Least 58 merit badges that Scouts can complete from home. The merit badges on the list meet two main criteria:
<ul>
<li>They don’t involve visits to public places or companies.</li>
<li>Their requirements can be completed indoors or in an average-size yard.</li>
</ul>Here is the link to the article on Bryan for Scouting.
<a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/03/20/merit-badges-for-social-distancing/">https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2020/03/20/merit-badges-for-social-distancing/</a>.
</p>
<p>During this challenging time, we sometimes find it difficult for Scouts to meet certain requirements. We can be tempted to apply "common sense" in interpreting those requirements But one fundamental of the merit badge program is that requirements must be met as written and no one, or no authority, can change those requirements, unless they are officially changed at BSA.</p>
<p>Several merit badges have requirements that a Scout "attend" a meeting or some other function. Our Council Advancement Chair has recently weighed in on this one. The dictionary meaning of "attend" is "be present at". That means the Scout needs to be present in person. Given that many meetings these days are on-line, if a Scout is present via Zoom, or some similar tool, as the meeting or function is happening, then that does meet the definition of "attend". However, watching a recording or time-delayed video stream does not meet the definition.</p>
<p>This means that certain merit badge requirements, including some Eagle required merit badges such as Citizenship in the Community, cannot be completed until the Scout can attend in person, or the meeting is conducted and available on some real-time, on-line platform. There are plenty of other merit badges that can be earned, and most requirements can be met while still maintaining the mandated social distancing.</p>
<a id="ar"></a>
<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Advancement Resources</strong></p>

<p>With the CONVID-19 situation, scouting has adapted. Boards of review, even Eagle Boards may be held electronically. <a href=
"https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/default/files/media/district/nt/Electronic_Boards_of_Review.pdf">Here</a> is a pdf document which describes the process.</p>

<p>Merit Badges may be in many cases worked on while scouts are stuck at home. <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-065.pdf">Here is a guide for Merit Badge counseling.</a></p>

<p>In all cases be sure and comply with the safe environment procedures outlined in Youth Protection Training.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Internet Advancement Access for Councils and Units</strong></p>
<p>The new Internet Advancement web platform is specially designed for both council employees and unit leaders to track and record unit advancements. The platform was built to optimize unit management and includes features that enable council employees or leaders to record the same advancement for many youth at once.</p>
<p>Since many of us are stuck at home, this is a great time to get up to speed on this new tool.</p>

Council Annual Recognition Banquet</strong></a></p>
<p>Please be aware that the event is now set for <span style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday, August 8th</span>. The council banquet is still on!</p>
<p>We learned this week that the Plano Event Center will remain closed for the whole month of June. We have moved the council banquet again to Saturday, August 8th. It will be at the same time at the same location. We are hoping that our new date in early August will allow our graduating seniors to attend before they leave for college.
We have implemented many changes for this year to further ensure the health of all who attend our event. The Plano Event Center has formulated plans that will follow strict guidelines and be approved by those regulating health standards for their industry. We have a long relationship with the Plano Event Center and feel confident with them and moving forward with our event. We are optimistic that Texans will continue to follow state safety guidelines and keep COVID 19 in check.</p>
<p>All who are currently registered for the event will remain registered. If you are no longer available for our event, you may cancel your reservation by emailing Michael Prachar at <a href="mailto:Michael.prachar@scouting.org">Michael.prachar@scouting.org</a> by July 20th to receive a full refund. You may also contact me to substitute the name of one of your paid guests. Please notify Leigh Anne LeBlanc, the council banquet chair, at <a href="mailto:leighcat3@gmail.com">leighcat3@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will keep you posted on the status of the event. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and your guests. As Scouters, we must do our part to protect the community and our families.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
