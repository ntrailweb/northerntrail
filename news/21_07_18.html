<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Leader Burnout</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I talked about the problem of getting help.  Another problem that leaders and units experience is “leader burnout.”   </p>
<p>It starts innocuously enough, an adult leader or two appear in unit full of enthusiasm and really carry the ball and things go very well for a time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this pace cannot be maintained, and things begin to fall apart.  Without much warning, a unit is suddenly challenged without strong leadership and fails to thrive.  </p>
<p>Why does this happen?  </p>
<p>The first reason which comes to mind is a failure to delegate tasks.  Too often it is just easier to do it yourself.  Additionally, often strong leaders have such high standards they are not willing to accept help which might not be quite good enough.</p>
<p>Another problem is lack of training. Too often we think we know the best way to implement a program when in fact there are techniques and methods we are unaware of. Unit commissioners have a wealth of knowledge about how to make a program successful that they are willing to share. Failure to tap into the training and unit service resources, leads to frustration and burnout.</p>
<p>A succession plan is critical, every unit should have as policy, rotation of roles in the unit, so the same person is not constantly doing the same job.  The more people are aware of the things that go on in the background the more value they will add to the unit.  </p>
<p>A successful unit leader will strive to involve every adult in the unit in some capacity even simple ones.  Ownership of some aspect of the program connects these individuals to the unit.  Parents with even minor roles in a unit are far more likely to have their scouts continue to be involved.  If it is important to the parent, the scout will notice! </p>
<p>So be alert for leader burnout, if you are not in a leadership position volunteer to help and take some load off that great leader who has made your unit such a success.  </p>
<p>Do not forget to delegate tasks and or remind others to delegate. Make sure you and others in your unit get trained and make use of the commissioner resources.  </p>
<p>Keep on scouting, make a difference.     </p>
