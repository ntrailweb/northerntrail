<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">District Executive Change</strong></p>

<p>Jorge Salazar has left Circle Ten Council to pursue a different career path. We thank him for his service to scouting and wish him well. A search for a new district executive is underway. In the interim, Michael Garcia, Field Director for North Central Service Area, will fill this role. Michael may be reached at: 214.985.1812 <a href="mailto:Michael.Garcia@Scouting.org">Michael.Garcia@Scouting.org</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Time to Recruit New Scouts</strong></p>
<p>Scouting is a great program and is of incalculable value not only to our own children, but to the community as a whole. This only works with a steady flow of new recruits and with the new recruits come new parents who are enthusiastic, dedicated, high energy and creative. Combine their talents with yours and your program will thrive! Please contact Membership Chair Bram Franklin to coordinate, ask questions or address concerns at (214)-609-9089 or <a href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com">bramfranklin@gmail.com</a> . COVID-19 will make recruiting very unique this year, but be creative and let's make more people Scouts!</p>

<strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Promote Cub Scouts in Your Neighborhood</strong></p>
<p>We would like every Cub Scout family to put out one of these free yard signs encouraging others in their neighborhood to join the adventure of Scouting. One person can order for their whole unit and older Scouts can get them too! They can be ordered at the following link and picked up at either Scout office: <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/54940/yard-signs">More information.</a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">The Churchill Plan</strong></p>
<p>Last year, the National Executive Committee of the BSA organized teams of volunteers and professionals from the local, area, regional and national level – including current or recent youth members and subject-matter experts – to develop plans on how to optimize the BSA for success in key areas based on input provided by more than 1,100 local, area, region and national volunteers and professionals. <a href="https://scoutingwire.org/understanding-the-churchill-plan-and-what-it-means-for-scouting/">Read more</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection</strong></p>
<p>A few Northern Trail scouters have brought their YPT cards up to date, but many have yet to do so. You cannot participate in any scouting activity either in-person on on-line unless you have a current YPT card. This includes merit badge counselors .</p>
<p>Check your card now! Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> to take the training. Takes about an hour.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Emergency Risk Management</strong></p>
<p>Now is a good time if you have not done it already to clean out your trailer and/or storage facility. For most of us with COVID-19 we have not used these. Bugs (Brown Recluse Spiders) can get into your items especially with the hot weather. While you are cleaning out check your first aid kits for completeness, expired items and items that might not be good if exposed to the heat. Check fire extinguishers to make sure they filled and not expired (date on bottom of the extinguisher) should be good for ten years. Finally, AED equipment check for expired pads and leads, is the battery charged properly, is there an adult responsible for the device and are the adults trained in CPR-BLS and is the certificate current. Questions: contact Risk Management Chair, Dr. Donald Blum <a href="mailto:donald.blum@yahoo.com">donald.blum@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Position Training</strong></p>
<p>Adults in leadership positions, Den leaders, Cubmasters, Scoutmasters and Crew Advisers must be position trained. Please make plans to get trained. In addition to specific training for your position, hazardous weather training is required. </p>

<ul>
<li>SM/ASM Leader Specific Training, 2 sessions 10/7 & 10/14</li>
<li>Adv. Backcountry Training Classroom 2 sessions + campout (10/8, 10/15, campout 10/24-10/25)</li>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
