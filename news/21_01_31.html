<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Momentum</strong></p>
<p>All of us have been impacted by this virus, however life has gone on and we must do our best to continue to make our community better. Part of that process is training a new generation of leaders to meet the challenges yet to come. Historically, scouting has made huge contributions to the success of our communities. Scouting values and skills are vital tools. As adult leaders in our units, we must strive to keep the momentum by holding meetings, campouts, events and getting trained. This can be done safely, with the proper preparation. Regular meeting place not available? Find another time and place to meet. Afraid to go camping? Learn about new protocols and how they have been successfully and safely implemented. Need advice? Talk to your unit <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">commissioner</a>, attend Roundtable, talk to scouter's in other units, check out the council website and other resources. Don't delay, while things are improving, we can't wait, build back the momentum today!</p>
