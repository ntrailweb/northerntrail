<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Summer Water Safety</strong></p>
<p>With summer weather in full swing, most of us will be getting into the water. With water activities comes the risk of drownings. Some simple steps and positive actions can reduce the number of these tragedies. The most important step with swimming activities is to designate someone to watch the activity without the distractions of conversation with others. With boating activities everyone must have a proper life jacket, no exceptions. Here is a website with more information and free materials to help you put a plan into action: <a href="https://www.poolsafely.gov/">https://www.poolsafely.gov/</a></p>
