<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>COVID-19 Response</strong></p>
<strong><p>We are still in a wait and see mode. It's clear that no matter what happens, we will have to make adjustments. The situation is still very much in flux and we just don't know how we will adapt, but we will adapt. The city of Richardson has implemented a "Shelter in Place" Disaster Declaration due to an increase in infections in our area. It does leave room for some outdoor activities with social distancing. So hikes and walks are permitted.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Website Transition</strong></p>
<p>As many of you are aware the old district websites are being phased out and moved to the new IHUB platform. We are working hard in Northern Trail to complete this task, but in the meantime we have made a copy of old Northern Trail Website content and will be maintaining that in the interim. You can find it here: <a homeurl >ntrail.org</a>. Please bear with us while we work to complete the transition. You can help by signing up on the council IHUB site so you will receive notifications when we complete the transition. <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/">circleten.ihubapp.org</a></p>

<p>The new Internet Advancement web platform is specially designed for both council employees and unit leaders to track and record unit advancements.

<p>Since many of us are stuck at home, this is a great time to get up to speed on this new tool.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight:bold;">Course Canceled</p>

<p>Northern Trail ALT (Adult Leadership Training) /IOLS (Introduction to Outdoor Leadership Skills) training is a destination. Over the past 5 months we have improved the course to make it more interactive and a more fun learning atmosphere. It is with a heavy heart that we have no choice but to CANCEL the Spring 2020 ALT/IOLS course. As you may be aware, the City of Richardson has declared a Shelter-In-Place order until April 30th.</p>
<p>We already have a fall ALT/IOLS course scheduled and look forward to helping you be trained either for your position or as an adult volunteer in your troop. Scout leaders should be trained. As we hope to have summer camp and many other scouting opportunities between now and our next ALT/IOLS session we encourage you to look for online training for “Leadership Specific” & “Introduction to Outdoor Leadership Skills.” We appreciate your service and hope to see you in our fall training classes. If you have already registered for the Spring Courses the course director will be in contact with you. Please stay well & pray for our world health.</p>

Council Annual Recognition Banquet</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Event has been rescheduled for May 19th.</span><br />
<p>You may have already read the message from Circle Ten stating that all council activities are forced to be cancelled through March 31st. That includes the council banquet. While we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, we do support efforts to keep our community safe and to protect our guests’ health. We have moved the council banquet to Tuesday, May 19th. It will be at the same time at the same location.</p>
<p>We have implemented a few changes for this year to further ensure the health of all who attend our event, and we will keep those changes for our new date. The Plano Event Center is also taking steps to follow enhanced health and safety guidelines and recommendations and we feel confident in moving forward with our event.</p>
<p>All who are currently registered for the event will remain registered. You are responsible for informing each of your guests of the new event date. It is important that you reach out to each of your guests registered through you and confirm their availability. If you are the main contact for your registration, you are the only contact we have. If there are those in your registration who cannot attend, please contact Leigh Anne LeBlanc at <a href="mailto:leighcat3@gmail.com">leighcat3@gmail.com</a>. We will be moving forward with preparations and we still need to give the Plano Event Center an accurate number. For those guests who are not able to attend on the new date, we will issue a full refund if you contact us by April 1st. After April 1st, any who have not replied that they cannot attend on May 19 will not receive a refund.</p>
<p>Depending on how many cannot attend the banquet on the new date, there may be room for people who were not able to register before. We will keep you posted. 
Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and your guests. As Scouters, we must do our part to protect the community and our families.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend this course at Philmont this summer!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>District Commissioner Minute</strong></p>
<p>This is a difficult time for all of us. We’ve had plans cancelled, had to cancel events and had to hold virtual meetings. I hope that your dens and packs, patrols and troops, and crews have been able to adapt to using new methods to continue your youths Scouting journey. Just to remind you, your commissioner corps consists of volunteer Scouter who works directly with Scout units and leaders to help them provide the highest quality Scouting program possible. As friends, teachers and counselors to unit leaders, Commissioners represent the ideals, principles and policies of the Boy Scout program while providing the resources of the district and council to the units they serve. The primary purpose of the Unit Commissioner is to help units succeed.</p>
<p>Do you need help creating a recruiting plan, your commissioner can help. Do you need to find a new place to go camping, your commissioner can help. Are your ceremonies tried, your commissioner can help. Need to connect with other Scouters, your commissioner and attending Roundtable can help. The possibilities are endless, but communication is a two-way street-your commissioners corps can’t help you unless you let them. If you don’t know who your unit commissioner is reach out to me at <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com">hjv3@outlook.com</a> or 214-769-5040. If you haven’t heard from your commissioner in a while, contact them.</p>

Yours in Scouting,<br />
Hank Voegtle, District Commissioner</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Deputy Chair / Vice Chair of Program Minute</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the Council, and all over the country, Scouts, Venturers and Scouters are meeting virtually through many means including technologies such as Facebook, Zoom, WebEx, and other teleconferencing applications along with the Discord app. There are opportunities all over to take ILST, ILSC, and several different Merit Badges. Just this week, I was on a virtual Eagle Board of Review! We do this in our everyday work lives when we work globally and this can work to bridge the gap until we can all meet again. If you have any questions about how any of these things work, reach out to me at <a href="mailto:tavares.joseph@gmail.com">tavares.joseph@gmail.com</a>.
