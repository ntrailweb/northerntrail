<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/district-awards-banquet-0">District Awards Banquet</a></strong></p>

<p>The banquet will be held at the Royal Oaks Country Club, 7915 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75231. We will honor our hardworking volunteers, hear from our new Scout Executive and have a great meal. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/district-awards-banquet-0">More information and ticket sales.</a> Don't put it off, tickets increase by $5 on January 9th.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Re-Charter Deadline</strong></p>
<p>Don't let your charter drop.  If your unit loses its charter you no long have a scout unit, your boys can't advance and you can't make use of the resources.  The process of putting the pieces back together is more involved than the normal re-charter. Don't let that happen.  Help is available. If you are responsible for getting your unit's re-charter submitted, please act today! Contact <a href="mailto:tavares.joseph@gmail.com">tavares.joseph@gmail.com</a> and he will assist you.</p>
<p>If you are not directly responsible for the re-charter, action on your part is still required. Make sure that you have paid your dues and that any required training, especially Youth Protection Training, or application forms have been submitted.</p>
<p>Our District Executive Chad Caudle still needs a copy of your unit roster, send it to, <a href="mailto:chad.caudle@scouting.org">chad.caudle@scouting.org</a>. This just a simple list of members. This helps cross check records and insures accuracy.  This is simple to do and will be a big help to Chad.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Youth Protection Training Deadline</strong></p>

<p>Your re-charter will fail if you attempt to complete the process with adults on the roster who don't have current youth protection training.    Every registered adult must have a current youth protection card to complete the annual re-charter process.  This required training is good for two years. Either the on-line or face-to-face training will meet this requirement. This is easy to fix by taking an online course. Online training is available here: <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a>.  The training does not take very long and is not difficult.</p>

<p>Nearly 38 million fire extinguishers manufactured by Kidde and sold between 1973 and 2017 are part of a nationwide recall.  Scout leaders should check their unit meeting sites, troop trailers, trunks and garages today to see whether their fire extinguishers are included.  There have been nearly 400 reports of affected models failing to activate in a fire emergency, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSC cites one death and 16 injuries. The affected models of Kidde (pronounced “kidda”) include plastic-handle fire extinguishers and plastic push-button fire extinguishers.  Check <a href="http://kidde.com">kidde.com</a> for list of specific units which are being recalled.</p>
