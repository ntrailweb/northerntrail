<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://bsaseabase.org/scouting/about/annualreports/2013_one.aspx">One Oath, One Law, One Movement</a></strong></p>
<p>At Scout meetings there is an opening ceremony which usually involves presenting the colors and reciting the Cub Scout promise, Scout oath or Venturing oath. This is done as a reminder that scouting is about instilling these ideas in our children. Presentation on <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/Cub_Scout_2015_New_Program_Overview.pdf">changes</a></strong> to Cub Scout program.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Training</strong> for Parents and Leaders</p>

<p><img src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/trained_small.png" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Scouting is unique and the methods are not intuitive. Training gives you the tools to be succesful as a scout parent and leader. Errors in execution derail participation and results. The goal is a safe and effective program which achieves the aims of scouting. As a parent you need to understand how scouting works. If you are trained, your child will get more out of the program, a lot more! Scout training is first rate and it's fun. So don't put it off, sign up and get up to speed on the program. Every registered adult must have youth protection training and some activities like Twilight Camp and Summer Camp require the Face to Face version of this training. <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/boy-scout-leader-specific-begins-3182015">Boy Scout Leader Specific</a></strong> Training, <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/outdoor-leader-skills-weekend-410-122015">Outdoor Leader Skills Training</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/wilderness-first-aid-5282015-5312015">Wilderness First Aid</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/ypt-face-face-council">Face to Face Youth protection</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://circleten.org/wood-badge">Wood Badge</a></strong> now available.

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Is Your Unit Re-charter Past Due?</strong></p>

<p><img align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/paper_work_50.png">Some units in Northern Trail have lapsed charters. This means that these units are about to be dropped. Don't let this happen. Unit commissioners and the district executive are available to assist you with the process. Don't wait until the last minute. Even if you are not the unit chairman or leader, getting the re-charter done is everyone's job. If your leaders have been asking for paperwork or needed youth protection training, please help them out by completing these tasks. <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/re-charter-checklist">More Information</a></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://circleten.org/camp-card-unit-sales-sign">Camp Card Sales</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="http://mt.ntrail.org/images/camp_card_small.png" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Camp Cards are a great opportunity for your scouts to earn money for camp and help support the scout program at the same time. It's not too late to get involved. Contact Jesus Vazquez (469.418.3231) or Tim McConville (214-773-0848) for assistance.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Your Participation is Essential!</strong></p>

<p>Scouting is a volunteer organization and without willing adults, the program can not function.</p> <p>Volunteers are needed in your immediate unit and this covers the range of duties from drivers, assistance with activities, unit leaders and merit badge counselors to name a few. Get involved, both you and your scout will benefit! If you are a leader and need help, ask!</p>
<p>At the district level we need help with activities. At the moment we are in particular need of people to help with the upcoming Twilight Camp. If you know of someone who would be great volunteer, please encourage them to help. Contact Rogge Heflin <strong><a href="mailto:rogge.heflin@roggeheflin.com">rogge.heflin@roggeheflin.com</a></strong> about these opportunities.</p>
