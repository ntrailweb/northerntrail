		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Summer Camp is Essential</strong></p>

		<p>A critical rite of passage for scouts is participation in a weeklong summer camp.</p>

		<p>Summer camp provides the opportunity for an extended outdoor experience very different from the norm. Opportunities to learn scout skills, earn merit badges, swimming, hiking, fishing, campfire programs and more are abundant.</p>

		<p>Summer camp takes your scout out of their comfort zone and challenges them to adapt to new situations and thrive.</p>

		<p>For many scouts, this is the first time they have spent any significant time away from home and the prospect can be a little frightening. In most cases scouts, will have one or more buddies going to camp and the unit will have veteran scouts who have one or more summer camps under their belts. Knowledge that familiar faces will be present, combined with the opportunity for great fun will go a long way toward allaying fears.</p>

		<p>A missed summer camp can put a real dent in your scouts advancement, and deny them a the opportunity to experience a key aspect of scouting.</p>

		<p>Any registered adult can attend one or more days at summer camp with their unit. Most units will divide up the week to ensure that the unit is well supervised. Participation at summer camp as an adult is a rewarding experience. It is a great time to relax and enjoy the outdoors while supporting your unit.</p>

		<p>Make plans now to attend summer camp.</p>
