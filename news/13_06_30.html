<h3>Commissioner Service</h3>

<table class="main" width=700> 
<tr><td>
One of the most important positions on the District Committee is that of the District Commissioner. This volunteer Scouter has a hardworking staff of Unit Commissioners that have the job of visiting and delivering important services to all of the units in the district. These services are designed to help volunteer leaders and parents deliver the promise of scouting to every youth member in the District.

<h3>Cubmobile Race Flagpole Hill</h3>

<table class="main" width=700> 

<tr><td>

Here is an opportunity for your Pack to earn the "Summer Time Pack Activity" award.<br /><br />


This event is sure to be fun for the entire family and bring some excitement to our summer Cub Scout program. Each Cub is encouraged to build their own car, or a den, patrol, or pack can work together to make a team car. Each team should keep their car-to-Cub ratio 1:5. The cars will race using gravity to propel them down the hill and across the finish line. Each car must comply with the safety rules that are outlined here before it will be allowed to race. There are design suggestions in the Bear rank book. You can also Google "cub mobile" for many other design ideas. Each Cub must wear protective gear -- a bicycle safety helmet, football helmet, or racing helmet; long pants; and no open toed shoes. Each Cub must be able to demonstrate how to steer and brake their car. Cubs will queue to race their cars in this fun and casual competition. <a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content/district-cubmobile-derby-0">More information.</a>
