<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Time to Recruit New Scouts</strong></p>
<p>Just because we have COVID to deal with, does not mean that we should put recruiting on hold. On the contrary, it's more important than ever to recruit. Our world, particularly our children are more connected than ever and we have lots of ways, both with technology and process to recruit and make a difference through scouting. We can do these things safely, we just need to creative and assertive. Both scouting traits!</p>
</p>Please contact Membership Chair Bram Franklin to coordinate, ask questions or address concerns at (214)-609-9089 or <a href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com">bramfranklin@gmail.com</a> . COVID-19 will make recruiting very unique this year, but be creative and let's make more people Scouts!</p>

<strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Promote Cub Scouts in Your Neighborhood</strong></p>
<p>We would like every Cub Scout family to put out one of these free yard signs encouraging others in their neighborhood to join the adventure of Scouting. One person can order for their whole unit and older Scouts can get them too! They can be ordered at the following link and picked up at either Scout office: <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/54940/yard-signs">More information.</a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection</strong></p>
<p>We still have some holdouts. YPT is designed to protect not only our scouts, but adult volunteers. It's vital that everyone understand the critical concepts and procedures which keep everyone safe. Just because might not be interacting in person does not change the requirement that all adults have a valid current YPT card. Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> to take the training. Takes about an hour.</p>
<p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Position Training</strong></p>
<p>Adults in leadership positions, Den leaders, Cubmasters, Scoutmasters and Crew Advisers must be position trained. Please make plans to get trained. In addition to specific training for your position, hazardous weather training is required. </p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
