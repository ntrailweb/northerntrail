<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Twilight Camp, Worth Attending</strong></p>

<p>Twilight Camp is coming in a few short weeks. <span style="font-weight:bold;">June 5th thru June 9th</span>. I’ve lost track of how many Twilight Camps I’ve attended, but it goes back a long way. My first experience was as a parent and walking den leader. Both of my boys had a great time and the enthusiasm was electric. The heat and humidity did not deter them from having a great time. While they were not aware of it, they learned many cool things from crafts, sports, basic first aid and careers. After my boys grew out of Cub Scouts I was still involved as an adult volunteer leader helping with the logistics of camp and working at stations. It’s a challenge, but rewarding working with young scouts. It's a real treat to see the sense of accomplishment when they complete a task.</p>
<p>If you have a cub scout, make sure and sign him up for this event. Do it quickly because the leaders running the program need to order t-shirts and supplies. 
Keep in mind that it’s a Twilight Camp and thus camp is only in session from 4:00PM to 8:30PM in the evening. In the years I done this I was always able to get away from work a little early that week and attend as a volunteer without burning vacation days.</p>
<p>This event would not be possible without volunteers of all kinds. First of all we need parents and grandparents to come and walk. We need a ratio of no more than 5 boys to 1 adult in each group. This can be challenging to schedule and the more walking den leaders we have the easier this will be. Walking with the boys is fun and rewarding. Not only can you observe the activities you can converse with other parents like yourself and learn a thing or two about raising kids! I know that I learned a lot this way.</p>
<p>We also need adults and older scouts to staff the various events. We have plenty of opportunities and the camp program director can provide details.</p>
<p>See you at Camp! <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/twilight-camp-june-5-92017">More information</a></p>

<p>Twilight Camp is coming fast. Walking den leaders are needed and everyone must complete the needed paperwork. Waiting until the last minute makes it difficult for everyone. The challenge for the organizers is to have enough walking den leaders and staff each day. Training, including Face to Face Youth Protection for walking den leaders, will be held in May. The remaining dates are May 18, and 25 from 7pm to 9 pm in Room 205 at First United Methodist Church in Richardson (503 N. Central Expressway, Richardson, TX 75080). All questions will be answered! Please bring your completed Medical forms A &amp; B to the training. You may also mail your completed forms to: <a href="mailto:registrar@ntrail.org">registrar@ntrail.org</a></p>

<p>We are looking for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to volunteer as Junior Staff at Twilight Camp June 5 - 9, 2017 at Breckenridge Park. It&#39;s a great opportunity to earn service hours.
