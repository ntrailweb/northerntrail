<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">It does not have to be a home run!</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" hspace="5" style="width:50%; float:right;" src="https://ntrail.org/images/big_bend.jpg">Many years ago, I was the high adventure chairman for our scout troop. I really enjoy backpacking and had experienced a Philmont trek with my older son a few years earlier. It occurred to me that a spring break trip to Big Bend National Park would be a great activity for the troop. Several of the dads were on board and we had a few scouts who were interested, but not strongly. I felt that we could easily take 15 to 20 scouts on this trip, and it would be a great success.</p>
<p>It did not turn out like I expected. In the end, I was only able to convince 6 scouts to attend and one of the 6 was my son!
My sales pitch had fallen on deaf ears. Most of the scouts could not visualize why this would be fun. In truth, they had no idea.</p>
<p>At the time I was very disappointed, here we had a great opportunity and yet only a few wanted to come. The dads were enthusiastic, but the scouts not so much.</p>
<p>We went to Big Bend National Park for spring break with only 6 scouts and 4 adults. On the way we spent the night at Monahans Sandhills State Park. The scouts had a blast sliding down the dunes and experienced powerful west Texas winds overnight. Already a great adventure and this was only the first night. We camped and backpacked in the high basin country and then in the desert. We day hiked into the Santa Elena Canyon. The crew took another day hike to the top of Emory Peak.</p>
<p>These six scouts had a great time and when we got home they enthusiastically told their friends about their adventure, most of whom were deeply disappointed they had not come on the trip.
In the end, of the 6 scouts who came on that trip, 5 made it to Eagle and the lone hold out got very close. Years later, one of the dads who did not come, told me that this trip made the difference, his boy was ready to quit scouts. Instead, he made it all the way to Eagle.</p>
<p>The trip was not a failure at all. We made a big difference in the lives of these 6 scouts, and they made a difference in the lives of their friends who learned a valuable lesson about missed opportunities. We had a great group of dads who made this all possible.</p>
<p>Every event does not have to be a home run, in fact sometimes the success is not seen until years later.</p>
<p>Keep on scouting, make a difference.</p>

<p>National Youth Leadership Training is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home troops and in other situations demanding leadership of self and others.</p>
<p>The NYLT course centers around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what he must KNOW, and what he must DO. The key elements are then taught with a clear focus on HOW TO.
