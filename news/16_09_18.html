<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong>
<p>This is the time of the year we think about who in Northern Trail should be recognized for their scouting efforts; this can be at the unit and/or district and council level.</p>

<p>At the unit level we have the Y.E.S.-Your Extraordinary Service Award, each unit can nominate 2 adults and 1 more for every additional 50 youth in the unit. Adults activity at district level- OA and District Committee can be nominated as well. The unit determines who receives the award.</p>
<p>The District Award of Merit is a council award presented by the district at their annual dinner. This person could have chaired one event or/and been involved in many scouting activities. A district committee selects the awardees from the nominations.</p>
<p>The Robert E. Little Award is a district award for long service to scouting. The district selects one person each year. </p>

<p>Additional information along with nomination forms for these three awards are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0</a> Additional supporting information can be included for the District Award of Merit and Robert E. Little awards. The deadline for each of these is Dec 1, 2016</p>
<p>The Silver Beaver is a the highest council award for scouters. The district gathers the nominations and forwards them to council. These scouters have made significant contributions to the scouting movement over a number of years. Additional information and forms are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award">northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award</a> Additional supporting information can be added. The deadline is Nov 1, 2016.<p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Re-Charter Time is Coming</strong>
<p>It will soon be time to re-charter your unit. Every adult must have a current Youth Protection card. Either the on-line version or the face-to-face version. Face-to-face is required for some activities like Twilight Camp and Summer Camp. Leaders must have specific training for their position. Avoid the rush, start working re-charter now! <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist">Re-charter Checklist</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fall Oak Leaf</strong></p>
<p>Oak Leaf will be held the weekend of November 12 and 13th.</p>
<p>Oak Leaf is a junior leader experience designed to supplement Troop level training and prepare Scouts for NYLT (National Youth Leadership Training).</p>
<p>Oak Leaf is highly recommended by Circle 10 as preparation for NYLT.</p>
<p>Webpage <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/oak-leaf-fall-2016-1112-132016"><strong>here</strong></a>. Registration for participants and staff now available.</p><p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>The Popcorn Game Is On!</strong></p>
<p>By now your Scout should have received his Popcorn Ordering Sheet during your unit’s Popcorn Sales kickoff. The deadline for turning in completed sales forms this year is Friday, October 14. Your Scout can earn up to 28% of his total popcorn sales revenue, money which can be used to fund his Scouting activities throughout the year. With a brand new product from CAMP MASTERS and the chance to win great prizes, excitement about popcorn sales is hopefully running high within your unit. For more information about our new popcorn vendor, visit <a href="http://www.campmasters.org">www.campmasters.org</a>.</p><p>We encourage all Scouts to not only participate in face-to-face sales but also to utilize the online sales system. Selling online is a perfect way to reach family and friends who live out of town or out of the country. Your unit popcorn kernel should have set up your Scout for online sales. He will need a 10-digit code assigned specifically to him in order to receive credit for online sales made by his friends and family. If you have any questions about online sales, contact your unit popcorn kernel.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, customers can support both Scouting AND the military through a $25 or $40 Military Donation. What a great opportunity to show our military how much we appreciate their service. If you have any questions about popcorn sales, you are welcome to call Patti or Trey Otte, Northern Trail District Popcorn Kernels. Here’s to a great year of popcorn sales!

</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Leader Appreciation Luncheon at Camp Wisdom!, October 8th</strong></p>
<p>Mark your calendars for the Leader Appreciation Lunch October 8th at Camp Wisdom. We had just over 100 people attend last year to explore over 30 booths of program features within Circle Ten and our four outstanding area camps.</p>
<p>Each unit should choose two people to attend this luncheon in their honor. Suggested attendees are decision makers in the unit’s program. BALOO Trained adults, Cub Masters, Scout Master, Advisors, Skippers, Outdoor Committee Members, Senior Patrol Leaders, Crew Presidents, Boatswains, or any other leader that can use the information and needs to meet the people involved in all of these programs. </p>
<p>
This is sure to be another great event. Lunch is provided by the Order of the Arrow Bistro and a small token of appreciation for all the program planning these folks do will be given out as well. More information including a registration link to come. Questions – contact Kim Huff (<a href="mailto:kimhuffdcd@gmail.com">kimhuffdcd@gmail.com</a>). </p>

<p>The 2nd Annual Outdoor Adventure was a success! The local community participated in numerous activities including rockets, fire building, rope bridge crossing, relay races, tug-of-war, and a GAGA pit. Many sampled homemade root beer and assembled a personal healthy trail mix. Scouts had the opportunity to demonstrate multiple points of the Scout Law—especially friendliness and cheerfulness. We had lots of new interest in scouting and were able to register Cub Scouts and volunteers. All who passed through the park observed Scouting in Action! Thanks to everyone who supported this event, and see you next year. <i>More pictures on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Northern-Trail-District/147525048691078" style="font-weight: bold;">Facebook page.</a></i></p>
