<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Impressive Eagle Scout Projects</p>
<p>Looking for ideas for Eagle scout projects?  Check out <a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2023/06/07/extreme-makeovers-round-49-eagle-scout-project-before-and-after-photos/"><strong>these</strong></a> before and after photos from projects from around the country.  These projects not only provide an opportunity for candidates to demonstrate leadership and organizational skills they are a mechanism for scouts to give back to the community.  The community notices and this helps raise the stature of the movement and encourages parents to get their children involved in the program so they will benefit from the opportunities for character development, leadership development, citizenship training and personal fitness.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">100 Days of Popcorn</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Richardson Flags Needs Help</p>
<img src="flag.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">
<p>The Richardson Rotary Club has been running a project for several years which places flags in neighborhoods. It a scholarship fund raising project and about 1/2 of the subscriptions fees goes for scholarships.</p>
<p>It's a great program and they have partnered with Scout units and other groups to help place and pick up the flags. Groups get compensated $1.25 per for each pickup or placement of a flag. So for example if you put out and pickup 100 flags you get $250 for your group. It's a great way to raise money for your unit and perform community service.
</p>

<p>If your unit would like to help with this worthwhile project, please contact Tim Quilici, Richardson Rotary Club
