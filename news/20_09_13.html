<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter</strong></p>
<p>From experience we know that waiting until the last minute to get this done is a recipe for pain. This can easily be avoided by starting now and work the <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist.html">checklist.</a> Before you know it the job will be done and on-time!</p>
<p>Every member of each unit has a role. Dues must be paid, applications submitted and required training completed. This will help your unit leadership complete this task on time. Without a completed on-time re-charter, your scouts can't advance, camp or function as a scout unit.</p>
<p>Venturers (aged 18-20) must have completed an adult registration form and the attached Background Check forms, position code VP, and complete Youth Protection Training prior to the re-charter to remain in the crew as Youth Participants. They are still youth, but because they are 18 or older, they must complete YPT and have the background checks completed. Start now and avoid the rush.</p> 
<p>Re-charter login codes should have been received by now. The Chartered Organization Representative and / or the unit Committee Chair should have them. If not received by the end of the month, see your <a style="font-weight:bold;" style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> for the code.</p>

<p>Don't panic, if you need help, contact your <a style="font-weight:bold;" style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> or Hank Voegtle <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a> </p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection Training is Required</strong></p>
<p>Remember as an adult you cannot participate in any scouting activity in-person or on-line unless you have a current Youth Protection Card. These expire every two years and because of changes two years ago, most of us need new cards. This includes Venturing scouts who are 18 years of age or older.</p>
<p>Your unit re-charter cannot be completed until every member has a current card. Avoid the rush, get it done today.</p>
<p>YPT is designed to protect not only our scouts, but adult volunteers. It's vital that everyone understand the critical concepts and procedures which keep everyone safe. Just because someone might not be interacting in person, does not change the <span style="font-weight:bold;">requirement</span> that all adults have a <span style="font-weight:bold;">valid current YPT card</span>. Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> to take the training. Only takes about an hour.</p>

<strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Recruiting New Scouts</strong></p>
<p>Now is the time to recruit new members. COVID makes even short-term planning challenging, but Circle Ten and the Northern Trail membership committee are working to make it successful. Remember with new scouts come new parents who are creative and enthusiastic. Materials to help you are available at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources</a>. There is an order form link on that page where you can order Cub Scout Business Cards, Scouts BSA Business Cards, Door Hangers (Cub Specific), Sticky Notes (Cub Specific), Yard Sign for families (Cub only), Yard Sign for the community (Generic Join Scouting), and customized videos which will include things such as your unit, a contact with phone and/or email, a date for a meeting, etc. Every Scouting family should have a yard sign, either Cub Specific or generic. Yard signs will demonstrate that Scouting is thriving in Northern Trail. Please contact Membership Chair Bram Franklin to coordinate, ask questions or address concerns at (214)-609-9089 or <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com">bramfranklin@gmail.com</a></p>
 
 <p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Leadership Training for Scouts</strong></p>
 <P>ILST, Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops is the BSA course to help Scouts learn how to become effective leaders. This course has replaced Oak Leaf and is to be presented at the troop level.</p>
<p>We will not have a district led course this fall, but hope to offer one this spring. Scouts learn about their roles in the PLC and how to run effective troop and patrol meetings. ILST is a prerequisite for NYLT. Information on this course for Scoutmasters is available. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/documents/ILST_guide.pdf">here.</a></p> <p>For more information, contact Dory Petsrillo, Training Chair. <a href="mailto:dlmp616@gmail.com">dlmp616@gmail.com</a></p>
 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2020NTALSIOLS">ALT / IOLS Training</a></strong></p>
<p>This training is for Leaders in the ScoutsBSA program and is targeted at leaders and parents who want to learn the details of how a troop operates. Emphasis is placed on Scout-Led activities and how to manage troop meetings and campouts. You learn by taking on the role of a scout and learn the ropes just as the scouts do in an actual unit. It's a fun rewarding activity and you will meet other scouting adults who are facing the same challenges. The Adult Leader Specific or ALT portion of the program will be done using Zoom and meets twice. The first meeting is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, September 30th at 7:00PM</span> and the second session is the following <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday October 7th at 7:00PM</span>. <p><strong>Introduction to Outdoor Leaders Skills</strong> is an actual scout campout over the weekend of <span style="font-weight:bold;">October 17th and 18th</span> at Camp Wisdom. The campout planning will be a part of the ALT training. To be considered "trained" you need to complete both ALT and the IOLS.</p>
<p>Registration is required. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2020NTALSIOLS">Registration now availabler.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">Popcorn</a></strong></p>
<p>Does your unit need to sign-up for the 2020 popcorn sale? Here are some incentives, if a Scout sells $250 dollars in popcorn they can attend day camp/winter camp for free or $100 dollars off an in-council camp. Click here for more popcorn reward information. For more information please contact Rachel Joslyn at <a href="mailto:Rachel.Joslyn@scouting">Rachel.Joslyn@scouting</a>.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has put a significant financial strain on the council. Popcorn sales is a big part of the income stream for the council and it helps units raise money for their programs and scout accounts. The popcorn program has adapted to the new normal and there are innovative ways to sell. Check out the details and get <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">signed</a> up today.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Revised COVID-19 Rules for Advancement</strong>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Extension of Time for Eagle Rank</span> - Earlier this year, National allowed councils to grant a 3 month extension to complete the Eagle requirements when inability to meet the requirements by the 18th birthday was caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. NEW: National has now allowed Councils to grant an additional 3 month extension under the same guidelines. This authority is currently set to expire on Dec 31, 2020.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Swimming</span> - Second Class (5b) and First Class (6a) swimming requirements may be deferred until each Scout’s next rank, as necessary (through Life, but not Eagle). In other words. a scout may advance up to Life by deferring these requirements until the Scout's first advancement after National reinstates these requirements. For that next advancement, the scout must pass any of these deferred requirements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Camping Merit Badge</span> - Requirement 9b is temporarily suspended (not deferred) until National restores it after the COVID-19 emergency. All other requirements, including camping nights, must be met to earn the Camping MB.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Can Merit Badge Requirements be Adapted</span> - Leaders and merit badge counselors must not make additions or deletions to requirements. The Scout is expected to meet the requirements as stated; in some cases, virtual “visits” may fulfill the intent of a requirement. When the requirement’s intent cannot be reached virtually, the requirements cannot be completed, and the Scout must wait to complete that badge/requirement. Merit badge counselors signing off on requirements must determine to the best of their ability if the Scout has demonstrated the intended outcome.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
