<h2>Sunday August 9, 2020</h2>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable, Cub Scouts / ScoutsBSA, August 13, 2020 </strong></p>

<p>Join us at the first Northern Trail Roundtable for 2020-21.</p>
<p>What is Roundtable? Roundtable is a forum where Scout leaders from all programs meet to get program ideas; information on policy and events; and training opportunities. It is a forum for sharing experiences and enjoying fun and fellowship with other Scout leaders. The roundtable experience will inspire, motivate, and enable unit leaders to provide a stronger program for their Scouts.</p>

<p>Everyone can attend Parents, Cubmasters, Assistant Cubmasters, Scoutmasters, Assistant Scoutmasters, Committee Chairs and Committee members. All we ask is that you come ready to learn, keep an open mind and participate!</p>

<p>Where is it and how do I get there? The August Roundtable will be online starting at 7:30 PM on Thursday, August 13.  Watch for an email on August 12 with details on how to attend.</p>
<p>Why attend Roundtable? Why not? There are reruns on broadcast TV, you’ve probably binge watched everything on your subscription services, and school hasn’t started, so you don’t have to help with homework. Seriously, you want to provide a great program for your unit’s youth, you want to get the latest news on recruiting, and you’ll find out you’re not alone!  Thursday,  August 13, 7:30 PM</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
