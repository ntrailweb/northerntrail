		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Secret to Keeping Your Scout in the Program</strong></p>

		<p>Iâ€™ve been involved in scouting for a very long time and participated in many Eagle boards of review. In almost every case, everyone on the board was well acquainted with the parents of the candidate.</p>

		<p>Your personal involvement with the unit in almost any capacity from front-line leader to membership on the unit committee is a strong indicator of your scout's success. In many cases the parent simply helped with transportation to campouts and events, but they demonstrated to their scout that the program was important enough to allocate some time and energy. Actions speak louder than words and your example makes all the difference. Involved parents are also better informed about how the program works and will provide the sometimes-needed nudges to complete that rank requirement or merit badge. Not everyone needs to be a scoutmaster, cubmaster, or den leader, but everyone can help a unit function.</p>

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">District Awards Banquet</strong></p>

		<p>The date for the dinner has been changed to February 23rd. COVID 19 put a real dent in our ability to recognize hard working volunteers and leaders in the district. In January we are planning to resume our annual district awards banquet. Expect a great meal, inspiring keynote speaker and a very enjoyable evening. Phyllis Slaughter <a href="mailto:phyllis.slaughter@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">phyllis.slaughter@gmail.com</span></a> is the chair of the dinner committee.</p>

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Training</strong></p>

		<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a href="https://my.scouting.org" style="font-weight:bold;"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p>

		<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>

		<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>

		<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p>

		<p>Watch the <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/calendar-events"><span style="font-weight:bold;">calendar</span></a> and newsletter for information about available training.</p>

		</p>

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>

		<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
			<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
			<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
