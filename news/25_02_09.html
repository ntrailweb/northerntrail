<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Thank you, Northern Trail, Thank you!</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 8, was the 115th anniversary of Scouting America and Scouts across the nation celebrated with a day of service and Northern Trail was no exception. We had four service projects across the district and a fantastic turnout.</p>
<p>While picking up litter at Breckenridge Park and Spring Creek Nature Area may not seem exciting, it was very worthwhile and productive. And the landscaping cleanup at First United Methodist repaid the church not only for hosting district meetings and events but several units. And collecting food and clothing for Network benefited our neighbors. Next week I’ll have a list of the units that participated along with the amount of service provided.</p>
<p>As a final note, someone left a pair of deerskin colored work gloves at Breckenridge Park. If they’re yours let me know.</p>
<p>Once again thanks to everyone who participated.</p>
