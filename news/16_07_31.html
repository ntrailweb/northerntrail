<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Second Annual Outdoor Adventure</strong></p>

<p>Mark your Calendar; Saturday September 10, 2016, Yale Park, <a href="http://ow.ly/IZ6F302EEdm">Map</a></p>
<p>Help us kick off our Fall recruiting by participating in the 2nd Annual Outdoor Adventure community event!  Northern Trail District and the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas are sponsoring a family day at the park for people residing in the Richardson Independent School District. Last year we had over 25 activities and hundreds of families around the Richardson area enjoying a fun-filled day of games and scout skills.</p>
<p>This event is a wonderful opportunity to promote your pack, troop or crew and demonstrate how much fun it is to be a Scout!  If you would like to sponsor and staff an activity, we will have a signup form on the website soon.  If you have any questions, please email Marjie Price at <a href="mailto:msmn1204@gmail.com">msmn1204@gmail.com</a>. </p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fall Training, Mark your Calendar</strong></p>

<p>Training dates have been posted to the calendar.  If you have leaders who lack training, please insure that they allocate the time to attend training.    Training is not just for front line leaders.  Parents who want their scout to get the most out of the program, should attend training and learn just how the scouting program works.  Training will make your job easier and you will get much better results.</p>

Selling popcorn is easy with the right training and support, and achieving high popcorn sales goals will help fund both your unit operations and the Council’s programming. Selling popcorn also teaches Scouts the value of contributing their time and effort to making the Scouting program the best it can be. Register TODAY!
