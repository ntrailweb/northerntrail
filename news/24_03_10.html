<img align="right" hspace="5" style="width:30%; float:right; margin-left:5px;" src="https://ntrail.org/clipart/camporee_2024.png">
<p>I've been to many Camporees over the years and I've noticed some interesting facts, first the <strong>energy, excitement and fun</strong> are very apparent. From the skills competitions, campfire program, OA call out ceremony and even the impressive camp gadgets on display.</p>
<p>The other interesting fact is that we always seem to have a number of units who don't show.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that these units are not aware of what they are missing. I'm sure of this because the the same units return year after year and the scouts always seem to have a great time. Even when the weather has been less than optimal.</p>
<p>If your unit has not been going to camporee, this is the year to start a new trend and give camporee a try, I guarantee that your scouts will have a great time and will clamor to return next year.</p>
<p>Get <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024TRJSpringCamporee1"><strong>signed up</strong></a> today! <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/camporee_2024_flyer.pdf"><strong>Flyer</strong></a> Expect a stellar event.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Friends of Scouting</strong></p>
<p>The friends of Scouting campaign is on track, but we are not over the finish line yet.</p> 
<p>Need a little nudge?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/FOS_2024_card.pdf"><strong>print</strong></a> this pledge card, fill it out and mail to Circle Ten, 8605 Harry Hines Blvd., Dallas, TX 75235, attention Northern Trail FOS.</p>
<p>You can email Patti Otte <a href="mailto:patti@otte.us"><strong>patti@otte.us</strong></a> and she will contact you.</p>
<p>You may give online <a href="https://donations.scouting.org/#/council/571/appeal/15"><strong>here</strong></a>, but be sure and enter <strong>Northern Trail</strong> in the district field.</p>
<p>Unit leaders, remind your scout parents of the importance of FOS for the success of scouting program through the support of program, camps and professional staff.</p>
<p>Scouting exists because of the tireless effort of volunteers like you, who make the program successful. These volunteers deserve support in the form of programs, camps, training and professional resources. All of which require funding. Any amount, large or small will help achieve scouting goals.</p>
<p>Scouting is not perfect, but it has had profound positive impact and we need to ensure it will continue for the benefit of our children and the community.</p>
