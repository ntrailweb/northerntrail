<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friendly</strong></p>
<p>The fourth point of the Scout Law is A Scout is Friendly.
A Scout is a friend to all. He is a brother to other Scouts. He offers his friendship to people of all races and nations, and respects them even if their beliefs and customs are different from his own. Scouting reinforces this basic value.</p>
