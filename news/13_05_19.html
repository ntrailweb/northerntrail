We are looking for a camp medic, program staff and range staff as well as someone to help with Logistics. Logistics is the person who delivers the supplies to the program areas before camp and picks them up at the end of camp each day. That person also makes sure that each area has water during camp. We will assign a strong teenager to assist so you would not need to do the heavy lifting.
