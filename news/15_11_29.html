<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/re-charter-time">Re-Charter Time</a></strong> </p>

<p>It's re-charter time. Every unit must complete the re-charter process annually.</p>

<p><img align=left vspace=5 hspace=5 src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/paper_work_50.png">What happens if your charter drops? Your unit no longer exists, your scouts can't advance, your unit can't participate in scouting events and may not use the scout camps. Additionally the paperwork involved it getting your unit re-chartered again is much more complicated.</p>

<p>Avoid the problems and get it done on time. If you are not responsible for the re-charter process in your unit, be sure and ask and support the person who is performing this task. He or she will need, your annual membership fees, training records and sometimes a form. Please act promptly and get these tasks done promptly.</p>

<p>If you are responsible for the re-charter process, <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">help is available</span>! Your unit commissioner is standing by to answer any questions you may have. If you don't know who your unit commissioner is, consult the website <a href="http://ntrail.org/content/unit-contacts"><span style="font-weight:bold;">ntrail.org/content/unit-contacts</span></a>. To help you with this process we have prepared a checklist which includes all the steps required. <a href="http://ntrail.org/content/re-charter-checklist"><span style="font-weight:bold;">ntrail.org/content/re-charter-checklist</span></a></p>
<p>Don't forget, start early and the process is much simpler, wait until the last minute and the task can be real headache. </p>

<p<img align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/small_BSACircleTenLogo.jpg">Scouting depends on volunteers and contributions to make the program run. Please take a moment to schedule a time for a presenter to come to your Court of Honor or Blue and Gold Banquet and make a short presentation about Friends of Scouting. It will only take about 15 minutes. It's essential that our local Circle Ten Council have adequate funds to implement this great program with the necessary camps, professional staff and service centers. Without these assets the program could not function. If you have questions contact: Jesus Vazquez <a href="mailto:Jesus.Vazquez@scouting.org">Jesus.Vazquez@scouting.org</a></p>

Make your reservation <a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/schedule-friends-scouting-presentations-0"><span style="font-weight:bold;">here</span></a> and someone will contact you to confirm.</p>
