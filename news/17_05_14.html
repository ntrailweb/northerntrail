<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Summer Camp</strong></p>
<p>Boy Scout Summer camp is an integral part of the scout program. Without the summer camp experience, scouts miss out on a huge part of what it means to be a scout. Scouts can make great progress toward rank advancement and many merit badges are best earned at summer camp. It may not seem logical to some adults, but if you have ever experienced summer camp, you know that the energy level is high and the experience is the highlight of the summer. If your scout has never been to camp, he does not know what he is missing out on! Some encouragement may be needed for that first experience and sometimes older scouts need to be "reminded" how much fun they had at camp.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that T-shirts and supplies must be ordered. Volunteers found and trained. Paperwork needs to be turned in and processed by our volunteer staff. Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone and makes in more difficult for the staff to focus on the fun! So if you have not signed up for Twilight Camp do it today.</p>
<p>Walking den leaders, adult camp staff and junior staff members are needed and everyone must complete the needed paperwork. Training, including Face to Face Youth Protection for walking den leaders, will be held in May. The remaining dates are May 18, and 25 from 7pm to 9 pm in Room 205 at First United Methodist Church in Richardson (503 N. Central Expressway, Richardson, TX 75080). All questions will be answered! Please bring your completed Medical forms A &amp; B to the training. You may also mail your completed forms to: <a href="mailto:registrar@ntrail.org">registrar@ntrail.org</a></p>
