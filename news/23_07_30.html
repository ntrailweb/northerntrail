<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recruiting</p>
<p>Recruiting is a year-round process, but most recruiting occurs in the fall. School nights for scouting are coming soon and history shows that when youth are exposed to scouting, they are enthusiastic. The more difficult part is selling the parents on the benefits of scouting. Keep in mind that scouting is not about entertainment, the fun is the hook and the goals are embodied in the AIMs of scouting codified in the scout oath and law.</p>
<p>Once you have made the "sale" it is vital to follow through and make new scouts and their parents feel welcome and become an active part of your unit.</p>
<p>Many join in the beginning of the year, but fail to continue in the program. This is where an active program of follow-though pays off. Plan on contacting the no-shows and work to keep them engaged in scouting. Just a little bit of effort can make a huge difference in your retention of new members. Don't leave it to chance, have a plan in place and work it.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Popcorn Sales</p>
<p>Unit Popcorn Training now underway. Attend and earn a bonus commission for your unit. Several opportunities coming up at the Fairfield office, August 2nd 7:00pm and August 5th 9am. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023PopcornTraining"><strong>More information.</strong></a></p>
<p>The council meets annual expenses in several ways and the annual popcorn sale is one of the critical fund raising components. Your unit's participation is vital to help meet the needed funding to keep Circle Ten's scouting program in sound financial condition.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Upcoming Training</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>Youth Protection Training</strong> This training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete this very necessary task.
