<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/news/58963">Mandatory Updated Adult Youth Protection Training</a></strong></p>

<p>The Boy Scouts of America's new updated Youth Protection Training is mandatory for all registered adult leaders in all BSA programs.  This is in <b>ADDITION</b> to Face-to-Face training which is still required for day camp, summer camp and winter camp.</p>

By October 1, 2018, all new and currently registered leaders will be required to complete the updated training.  Please see the <a href="http://circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/new_ypt2_update_quick_facts.pdf">Quick Facts</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>The new updated online Youth Protection Training does not replace the current Face-to-Face Youth Protection Training to be compliant with Title 25, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 265, Subchapter B, Texas Youth Camps Safety and Health.<br />
If you have any questions please contact: <br />
Circle Ten Council Program Director, Karen Thunert<br /> 
Circle Ten Council YPT Champion, Kresha Alvarado</p>
<p>This does not replace F2F (yet) but is in addition to F2F if that is the only training you receive for YPT.  As you know, F2F is required for any long-term camp (more than 72 hours).</p>
<p>In addition, Adult Volunteers now must have this YPT, along with the other Leader-Specific Training for their role in order to qualify for the Trained designation.</p>
