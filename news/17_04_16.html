<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Limits to Growth</strong></p>
<p>Some of you may be aware that the number of scouts in our district has declined since last year at this time. We hope to make up this shortfall with some active recruiting, but what are the underlying reasons?</p>
<p>While other activities are a factor, the real problem is the lack of adult volunteers.</p>
<p>Scouting has very few paid professionals. The real boots on the ground come from volunteers like you within the units. Committee members, scout masters, cub masters, den leaders and crew advisors are all volunteers.</p>
<p>The backbone of the organization is the unit committee, made up of volunteers like you who help make it happen. The committee chair has the critical task of recruiting volunteers and coordinating activities of the committee.</p><p>The reason the committee exists, is to make good use of the talent available and spread the load so no one person is burdened with all of the work.</p>
<p>So when your committee chairman or unit leaders asks for help, please step up to the plate and get involved. Even a small amount of effort makes a difference. The program will suffer without adequate help. Units which drop are usually due to a lack of willing adult leaders, there are plenty of youth who want to participate in the program.</p><p>So next time you hear a call for help in your unit, step up and help make it a success. Remember the life of the unit and service to future scouts depend on your efforts.</p>

<p>Scouts should take advantage of this great opportunity to
earn their age appropriate religious emblems by

Scouts can earn their emblems in one two-hour

majority of the requirements in this one session. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/jewish_religious_emblems_workshop-20170423.pdf">More information</a></p>

Twilight Camp would not be possible without parents and grandparents who volunteer to help with the event. These Waling Den Leaders attend camp and walk with the scouts from station to station. It's not difficult and it's fun. You only need to be present during camp each day form 4pm until 8pm. If you can't come every day you can come part of the time. The challenge for the organizers is to have enough den leaders each day. Training, including Face to Face Youth Protection for walking den leaders will be held in May. The dates are May 4, 18, and 25 from 7pm to 9 pm in Room 205 at First United Methodist Church in Richardson (503 N. Central Expressway, Richardson, TX 75080). All questions will be answered! Please bring your completed Medical forms A & B to the training.</p>

<p>Join us for a week of fun adventures as we explore the world of creepy crawly bugs. Twilight Camp is the perfect way to start your summer time fun. Earn Cub Scout achievements, have tons of fun with your den, and meet new Scouting friends! Registration now available.<br /></p>
