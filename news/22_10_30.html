<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">It is Time to Recognize Adult Scouters</strong></p>
<p>It is this time of year when we recognize our fellow scouters for the exemplary volunteer work that they do at the unit, district, and council levels. We remain thankful to them for their tireless service.</p>
<p>We have several awards to recognize these individuals beginning at the unit level with the Your Extraordinary Service Award or the Y.E.S. Award. At the district level we have two awards: the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Applications for these awards must be submitted no later than Friday, December 9th. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>At the Council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Applications for the Silver Beaver Award must be received no later than Monday, November 21th. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>Self-nominations will not be accepted.</p>
<p>More information, including the submission details of these awards, is available <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0.html"><span style="font-weight:bold;">here</span>.</a></p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <a href="mailto:mzi@gatech.edu"><span style="font-weight:bold;">mzi@gatech.edu</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">District Awards Banquet</strong></p>
<p>Save the date, Evening of January 19, 2023. COVID 19 put a real dent in our ability to recognize hard working volunteers and leaders in the district. In January we are planning to resume our annual district awards banquet. Expect a great meal, inspiring keynote speaker and a very enjoyable evening. Phyllis Slaughter <a href="mailto:phyllis.slaughter@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">phyllis.slaughter@gmail.com</span></a> is the chair of the dinner committee.</p> 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Upcoming Roundtable</strong> </p>
<p>Date & Time: Thursday, November 10th @ 7:00 PM<br />
Place: First United Methodist Church Richardson (503 N Central Expy 1000, Richardson, TX 75080)<br />
<p>You might be asking yourself‚Ä¶ "Have there even been monthly roundtables in Northern Trail?" That being said, there is a reason you haven't heard a lot of talk about it throughout this year‚Ä¶ it's because we haven't consistently held it throughout the year due to past low attendance and interest. However, recently, we've been getting a lot of volunteer feedback that holding it (at least quarterly) would be really helpful for units to be more connected to their commissioner, surrounding units, and helps you "be in the know‚Äù on things happening seasonally. We're scheduling this for YOU to be more equipped and supported in how to lead your unit. This is a resource for you. And it is perfect timing as recharter is RIGHT around the corner and we want to help get you started. We'll give you instructions on "how to recharter," upcoming programs, and give you an opportunity to meet your commissioner (and if you haven't already‚Ä¶ me!) to get your questions answered. Please invite the adult in your unit spearheading the recharter process to attend as well.</p>
<p>For those that haven't heard of roundtable‚Ä¶ here's what it is: Roundtables provide unit leaders with the skill to do and the will to do what is needed to ensure that every member of every unit has a great Scouting experience. They build upon the foundation provided by position-specific basic training and each leader's commitment to serving youth through Scouting. It exists for the purpose of providing and capturing information, offering current program training, and provides networking opportunities.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there! üòä</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Service Opportunity</p>
<p>Greetings Scouters. Do you have Scouts or a unit that needs Service hours or a project ..or just wants to 'do a good turn' and be 'helpful'?</p>
<p>The Arlington Charities organization (<a href="https://www.arlingtoncharities.org/"><span style="font-weight:bold;">link</span></a>), a non-profit charitable organization that fights 'hunger, poverty and homelessness' has asked for help from Scouts. The Program Director is Casey McCollum, a legacy Eagle Scout from North Trail District. He has started a program asking for donations of usable sleeping bags to be distributed to those folks on the streets with no shelter and in real danger in the coming cold months.</p>
<p>If you and your Scouts are willing to help, please check your unit storage rooms, the trailer and even theirs and your own Scout storage closet for older, no longer used, or extra sleeping bags that could be a life saver for someone in need.</p>
<p>If you find such sleeping bags, please contact John McCollum at 214.497.5276 or <a href="mailto:jmccollum0@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">jmccollum0@gmail.com</span></a> and I will arrange for collection and transport to the Arlington shelter.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone.</p>
