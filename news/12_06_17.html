<h3>A New Beginning:</h3>

<p>This the very first Northern Trail District newsletter. As in the past, we are going to try and keep the website, <a href="http://www.ntrail.org">www.ntrail.org</a> synchronized with the newsletter, so if you see something in the newsletter you should be able to find the item on the website. To keep the newsletters short and to the point we will continue our practice of short descriptive headlines linked to more detail on an external website. Since this newsletter is directed at scouters involved in all levels of scouting from Tigers to Venturing, there will always be content which is not of general interest. The goal is for the reader to be able to quickly scan the descriptions and find the ones relevant to them. As always we are anxious to get feedback both good and bad. Of course, errors in content need to be corrected quickly, so please take a moment and report these to the <a href="mailto:webmaster@ntrail.org">webmaster@ntrail.org</a>.</p>

<p>Be sure and remind everyone in your unit that they should sign up for and read the newsletter. The signup link is on the website and it just takes a minute to enter the required information.</p>

<h3>High Adventure-Venturing Forum:</h3>

<p>Next meeting, Tuesday June 19th, 7:30pm 	Project C.O.P.E. 
<a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content/high-adventure-forum">More information</a></p>

<h3>Twilight Camp Achievements</h3>

<p>Twilight Camp achievements may be found here: <a href="http://mt.ntrail.org/pdf/TwilightCamp2012ProgramAchievements.pdf">mt.ntrail.org/pdf/TwilightCamp2012ProgramAchievements.pdf</a></p>

<h3>Training:</h3>

<p>It won't be long before the school year begins and that means it will be necessary to train the next generation of adult leaders. Be sure and plan on attending training. Also please identify other adults in your unit who should go to training and remind them of how important this is to the success of the program. As soon as we have dates and times established, they will be announced on the website. If you have question or are interesting in working on the training team, please contact our training chairman, Bill Wilson at <a href="mailto:wrw@billwilsonlaw.com">wrw@billwilsonlaw.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Programs:</h3>

<p>The district will be operating a number of events during the scout year and we will need volunteers to assist with these activities. Volunteering is very rewarding and everyone has a good time. It is very satisfying to realize that your efforts change the lives of so many of our youth. Even a single event can make the difference between a child staying in the program instead of dropping out. If you would like to help with one or more of these programs, please contact Lloyd Duty. Lloyd can be reached at <a href="mailto:lhduty@sbcglobal.net">lhduty@sbcglobal.net</a> or 214-215-6831.</p>

<h3>Commissioner Service:</h3>

<p>If you have been involved in scouts for a long time and particularly if your child has moved on, commissioner service is a great way to keep up with scouting and make a difference. A commissioner is an individual who is knowledgable about the program and has first hand knowledge of the challenges which face new leaders. The job of a commissioner is not to directly work with a unit, but rather be a mentor and sounding board for new leaders who are just getting started and need advice and encouragement. Commissioner service requires a minimal investment of time, but is very rewarding. If you think you might be interested in commissioner service, please contact our Distrct Commissioner, Dick Dawson at <a href="mailto:dick.dawson@sbcglobal.net">dick.dawson@sbcglobal.net</a>.</p>

<h3>Membership:</h3>

<p>Membership is a critical function because we must constantly bring new scouts and adults into the program. Units which actively work to recruit new members have great programs and those that don't wither and fade. Our District Membership chairman is there to help promote membership growth. Please support the chairman. Paul Dodson may be reached at <a href="mailto:pauljdodson@yahoo.com">pauljdodson@yahoo.com</a> or 972-979-2852. Make membership growth and retention a key part of your unit planning.</p>

<h3>Twilight Camp:</h3>

<p>The achievements will be communicated on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/364673424611/">Facebook</a> page and the individual district web pages when they are available. You can find some great photos of the event on Facebook as well.</p>
