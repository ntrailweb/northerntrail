<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Recognize Scout Leaders</strong></p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p>The scout program is a great blessing. It has changed my life for the better. I am very thankful for all of the adult leaders over the years who helped me as a scout. As an adult, I am thankful for the volunteers and professional scouters who work so hard to make the scouting program possible for the community.</p>
<p>One way to thank these volunteers, is to recognize their contributions publicly. We have several adult awards and every unit has someone who should be recognized.<p>The Y.E.S. or Your Extraordinary Service award is one way to do this. Sure, it's just a piece of paper, but they can hang it on the wall and remember that their efforts were appreciated.  I have one on my wall and I'm proud to display it.  Someone took the time to nominate me for this award. Nominating someone is easy, just go to the website and fill out the on-line nomination form.   <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/yes-your-extraordinary-service-award">http://northerntrail.circleten.org/yes-your-extraordinary-service-award</a></p>
<p>There are awards for volunteers who contribute at the district level, these are people who help make district operate, like Unit Service, Training, Twilight Camp, Camporee, Webelos Woods, to name a few. Their efforts are often not as visible, but vital to the success of the program.</p><p>The District Award of Merit is a council award presented by districts or Venturing divisions in the same manner that the Silver Beaver is a national award presented by councils. The nomination form may be found here:  <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/district-award-merit">http://northerntrail.circleten.org/district-award-merit</a>.  If you download the form to your computer you can fill it out and email it to the awards chair Dr. Harry Yankuner 	<a href="mailto:HY18@sbcglobal.net">HY18@sbcglobal.net</a>.</p>
<p>The Robert E. Little Award recognizes extraordinary service to the scouting movement at the district level.  More information may be found here: <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/robert-e-little-service-award">http://northerntrail.circleten.org/robert-e-little-service-award</a></p>
<p>If you have any questions about these awards or need assistance with the nomination process, please contact Dr. Harry Yankuner 	<a href="mailto:HY18@sbcglobal.net">HY18@sbcglobal.net</a> and he will be happy to assist you.</p>  

<p>Yours in Scouting,</p>
