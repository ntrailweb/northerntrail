<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Youth Training Opportunities</p>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about adult leader training, but scouting offers many opportunities for scouts to get leadership training. Leadership roles are required for Star, Life and Eagle rank advancement.</p>
<p>Leadership development is an integral component of life skills training. By assuming leadership roles, scouts gain valuable experiences that foster their growth as citizens, employees, and parents. These experiences equip them with the understanding and resilience to navigate the complexities of life's challenges.</p>
<p>Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops or ILST is a weekend leadership training program for Scouts BSA youth.  There are age and rank requirements to be eligible.  More information <a href="https://www.scouting.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/721-07218-ILST-Facil-Training_WEB.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>National Youth Leadership Training or NYLT is an intense six-day course for youth members of troops, crews and ships. The content is delivered in a troop and patrol outdoor setting.  It is designed to be fun, challenging and is a life changing experience.  A scout must have completed ILST and meet other requirements to be eligible. More information <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/54750/nylt2"><strong>here</strong></a>. </p>
<p>National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience or NALYE is available at both Philmont and the Bechtel Summit high adventure bases.  More information <a href="https://www.scouting.org/programs/scouts-bsa/troop-resources/nayle/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>Those of us who have been involved with scouting for many years know that the recharter process can be a little painful. Avoid the pain in two ways, first don't wait until the last minute. The second way to avoid headaches is to follow the <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>procedure</strong></a> and ask questions if you have any doubts. Seeming minor things like signatures will land your recharter in the "defective" pile and the problems will need to be worked.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for recharter in your unit, make sure your dues are paid and any required training is complete. An out-of-date YPT card is a non-starter!  Please do your part.  Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>Youth Protection Training Current?</strong></a></p>
<p>Your unit cannot complete Recharter if your YPT card is not current. Time flies, check your card and take the training if needed. Get training at: <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. Don't wait, get done now.</p>
<p>Unit leaders, check the status of the adults in your unit now online.</p> 
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>Financial Aid</strong></a>
 <strong>Deadline: December 1, 2023</strong></p>
<p>Financial aid is available for families who need help with scouting expenses. More information available <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://www.scoutingevent.com/571-2024NTDistrictDinner"><strong>Adult Scouter Recognition Awards Banquet</strong></a></p>
<p>Our annual adult awards banquet will be held on February 22, 2024, 6:45p.m. First United Methodist Church, Richardson. Tickets may be purchased online <a href="https://www.scoutingevent.com/571-2024NTDistrictDinner"><strong>here</strong></a></p>  

<p>Please help us recognize these hard working volunteers by nominating them for an award.</p>

<p>You can nominate someone in your unit for the <a href="http://ntrail.org/yes"><strong>Your Extraordinary Service award</strong></a>, which recognizes volunteers at the unit level.  <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/district-award-merit.html"><strong>The District Award of Merit</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/robert-e-little-service-award.html"><strong>Robert E. Little Award</strong></a> recognize exceptional service by scouters at the district level.  At the council level the <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/92-103.pdf"><strong>Silver Beaver Award</strong></a> recognizes scouters who have provided exceptional long-term service to scouting.</p>  
<p>Leaders work hard and sometimes worry that their efforts are not appreciated. An award is tangible evidence that yes, their contributions are valued. It does not take much time to nominate someone, however the impact can be substantial. </p>

<p>Please don't delay, get your nominations in as soon as possible.</p> 

<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <strong>mzi@gatech.edu</strong>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>Winter Camp Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp</strong></a> December 27- 31, 2023</strong></p>

<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA Troops, Venturing Crews, and Sea Scout Ships.  It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.</p>
<p>Units camp jamboree style with multiple Units in a single campsite.  The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards.  Food is prepared by each Unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ).  <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>More information.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024Rendezvous">Rendezvous 2024</strong></a></p>
<p>March 8-10 (most activities on the 9th).  Registered Venturers, Sea Scouts, and Explorer Post members are invited.  We will be inviting people from the entire NST 8 (National Service Territory) this year and are hoping to restore the event to pre-COVID days.  Much planning to be done but we need people to save the date and consider joining a Venturing Crew if they want to participate.</p>
<p>We have solved the pistol issues, at least for now, and are looking forward to a terrific event this coming spring.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Upcoming Training</strong></p>

<p>Fall training has concluded.  On-line training is available at <a href="http://my.scouting.org"><strong>here</strong></a>.  Don't overlook hazardous weather training which is required for campouts. In person training will be scheduled in the spring, watch the calendar and newsletter for details.</p>
