<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024UniversityofScouting"><strong>University of Scouting</strong></a></p>
<p>The University of Scouting is a day-long council wide event held every year in January.  This year it will be held on <strong>Saturday January 13, 2024</strong>.  Volunteers from all over the council with extensive scouting knowledge will come together to offer a full menu of courses on every aspect of scouting.  The catalog is a full 22 pages in length to provide some prospective on the breadth and depth of the available material.  You can find it <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/executeReport.php?PARAM_ReportSubTitle=&PARAM_OrgName=CIRCLE+TEN+COUNCIL&ok=BSA571&uid=1&PARAM_uid=1&rip=418&PARAM_REPORT_ID=418&regID=0&PARAM_reportLevel=0&PARAM_reportBySession=0&PARAM_URLBASE=&PARAM_SUPPRESS_TOTALS_FLAG=1&PARAM_CLASS_CATALOG=0&PARAM_CLASS_CATALOG_ALL=1&PARAM_ORGKEY=BSA571&PARAM_LOCATION_ID=0&PARAM_LOCATION_ID_ALL=1&PARAM_INSTANCE_ID=71309&PARAM_ReportTitle=Class+Catalog&PARAM_ReportCampName=2024+University+of+Scouting+&PARAM_ReportSDate=&PARAM_ReportEDate=&uri=%2Freports%2FJasper4_5_0%2FSESClassCatalogInst2Loc1&PARAM_IS_IGNORE_PAGINATION=false&format=PDF&PARAM_REPORT_TYPE=P"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Courses available include: basic leader training, crafts, camping, cooking, finances, Autism, ADHD, backpacking, backcountry navigation, NOVA, social media, unit websites and more.  A full suite of commissioner training is also available to provide training for commissioner service.</p>
<p>We are fortunate in Northern Trail that the primary site is the Region 10 Service center campus located at the corner of Abrams Road and Spring Valley Road.  Some courses will be held at Camp Wisdom.</p>
<p>Regardless of your scouting experience you will find something of interest at the University of Scouting.  Mark your calendar and plan to spend the day.  <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024UniversityofScouting"><strong>Registration</strong></a> is available now.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>Time is running out. Late re-charters are hard on everyone. Time to <strong>Git er done</strong> </p>
<p>Don't fret, help is available. If you have questions, please ask. Your unit commissioner or the district executive will be happy to answer any questions about the process.  By the way the details of how to get it done may be found <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A lapsed charter can be a real headache. Your scouts can meet, camp or advance and if you delay too long the entire process becomes much more complicated. Essentially you must start from scratch. Please don't let that happen.</p>

<p>If you are not responsible for recharter in your unit, make sure your dues are paid and any required training is complete. A current Youth Protection Card is required. Get it on-line <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>here</strong></a>. Please do your part.  Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://www.scoutingevent.com/571-2024NTDistrictDinner"><strong>Adult Scouter Recognition Awards Banquet</strong></a></p>
<p>Our annual adult awards banquet will be held on February 22, 2024, 6:45p.m. First United Methodist Church, Richardson. Tickets may be purchased online <a href="https://www.scoutingevent.com/571-2024NTDistrictDinner"><strong>here</strong></a></p>  

<p>Please help us recognize these hard working volunteers by nominating them for an award. Without nominations we can't properly recognize the hard work of these volunteers.</p>

<p>You can nominate someone in your unit for the <a href="http://ntrail.org/yes"><strong>Your Extraordinary Service award</strong></a>, which recognizes volunteers at the unit level.  <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/district-award-merit.html"><strong>The District Award of Merit</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/robert-e-little-service-award.html"><strong>Robert E. Little Award</strong></a> recognize exceptional service by scouters at the district level.  At the council level the <a href="https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/92-103.pdf"><strong>Silver Beaver Award</strong></a> recognizes scouters who have provided exceptional long-term service to scouting.</p>
<p>Please don't delay, get your nominations in as soon as possible.</p> 

<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <strong>mzi@gatech.edu</strong>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>Winter Camp Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp</strong></a> December 27-31, 2023</strong></p>
<p>If your unit has never participated in Winter Camp this is the year to change that. It's lots of fun and we guarantee it won't be "hot."</p>
<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA Troops, Venturing Crews, and Sea Scout Ships.  It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.</p>
<p>Units camp jamboree style with multiple Units in a single campsite.  The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards.  Food is prepared by each Unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ).  <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>More information.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024Rendezvous">Rendezvous 2024</strong></a></p>
<p>March 8-10 (most activities on the 9th).  Registered Venturers, Sea Scouts, and Explorer Post members are invited.  We will be inviting people from the entire NST 8 (National Service Territory) this year and are hoping to restore the event to pre-COVID days.  Much planning to be done but we need people to save the date and consider joining a Venturing Crew if they want to participate.</p>
<p>We have solved the pistol issues, at least for now, and are looking forward to a terrific event this coming spring.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Upcoming Training</strong></p>

<p>Fall training has concluded.  On-line training is available at <a href="http://my.scouting.org"><strong>here</strong></a>.  Don't overlook hazardous weather training which is required for campouts. In person training will be scheduled in the spring, watch the calendar and newsletter for details.</p>
