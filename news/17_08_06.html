<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Roundtables This Week</strong></p>

<p>Cub Scout, Boy Scout and Venturing Roundtables will be held on Tuesday August 8th at 7:00PM. Location will be the First United Methodist Church of Richardson. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CWcGo3yZCMv">Map</a>

<p>The topic for the Roundtables will be recruiting.</p>

<p>Your last chance for an open forum on Recruiting Boy Scouts before this year's Join Scouting Night. We hear about your diminishing numbers and low-to-no recruiting years. This is your "take action" chance to beef up your membership. Please Join us Tuesday at 7:00 PM at the First United Methodist Church in Richardson Rm 230. You're bound to take away some worthwhile ideas, and you probably have some great ideas to share with other leaders. And remember, if it wasn't important for you to attend, wouldn't ask.</p>
