<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Time Management</strong></p>
<p>There is an old story about a demonstration which goes something like this. A teacher brings out a large jar in front of a group of students and begins carefully placing rocks in the jar. Eventually the jar will hold no more rocks and the teacher asks, "Is the jar full?" One of the students quickly says yes. The teacher brings out some pebbles and begins to add them between the bigger rocks, eventually no more pebbles can be added. "Is the jar full now?" Not immediately seeing where this is going, one student says yes. The teacher then brings out a jar of sand and with some effort is able to add sand such that no voids are apparent. Is it full now? The students are not so sure. The teacher brings out a large pitcher of water and pours the entire contents into the jar and the water rises to the rim. "Is it full now?" With some hesitation a few say yes.</p>
<p>There are several lessons in this story, first of course is that a problem may be more nuanced than it first appears. One lesson I have heard attached to this story is that with life, one needs to address the big things first. Make sure the important things get done first. Then you can find spaces for those other things you want to do. Another lesson is that while one may feel overwhelmed, there is more energy, time and opportunity than may be first apparent. Lastly my favorite life lesson is to remind scouts and adults that they can accomplish, learn and do more, much more than they think they can. Never underestimate your own potential. Coaxing that last bit of water into the jar may be difficult, but there is more room than you think!</p>

<p>Webelos Woods is an awesome opportunity for Webelos (and their parents) to experience some of the fun that they can look forward to once they cross over into a troop. Troops will host Webelos Scouts from various packs and will form patrols which will include those Webelos Scouts for the weekend. Packs will be assigned to camp with a host Troop by the event staff.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the patrols will rotate in a round-robin style of activities where they can visit with different Troops. Each patrol will learn a variety of different outdoor and Scout skills and put them to use in live demonstrations. On Saturday night, both districts will come together to enjoy a rousing campfire program with yells and skits! There will also be a OA Brotherhood ceremony on Saturday evening.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Upcoming Roundtable</strong> </p>
<p>Date & Time: Thursday, November 10th @ 7:00 PM<br />
Place: First United Methodist Church Richardson (503 N Central Expy 1000, Richardson, TX 75080)<br />
<p>You might be asking yourself‚Ä¶ "Have there even been monthly roundtables in Northern Trail?" That being said, there is a reason you haven‚Äôt heard a lot of talk about it throughout this year‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because we haven‚Äôt consistently held it throughout the year due to past low attendance and interest. However, recently, we‚Äôve been getting a lot of volunteer feedback that holding it (at least quarterly) would be really helpful for units to be more connected to their commissioner, surrounding units, and helps you "be in the know‚Äù on things happening seasonally. We‚Äôre scheduling this for YOU to be more equipped and supported in how to lead your unit. This is a resource for you. And it is perfect timing as recharter is RIGHT around the corner and we want to help get you started. We‚Äôll give you instructions on "how to recharter," upcoming programs, and give you an opportunity to meet your commissioner (and if you haven‚Äôt already‚Ä¶ me!) to get your questions answered. Please invite the adult in your unit spearheading the recharter process to attend as well.</p>
<p>For those that haven't heard of roundtable‚Ä¶ here's what it is: Roundtables provide unit leaders with the skill to do and the will to do what is needed to ensure that every member of every unit has a great Scouting experience. They build upon the foundation provided by position-specific basic training and each leader's commitment to serving youth through Scouting. It exists for the purpose of providing and capturing information, offering current program training, and provides networking opportunities.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there! üòä</p>
