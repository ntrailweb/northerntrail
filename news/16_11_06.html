<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Re-Charter Today</strong></p>

<p>Every unit must re-charter each year.  On time re-charters are much easier than dealing with an expired charter.   Start early and it's not overwhelming, wait until the last minute and it's very hard on everyone!  Help is available, your unit commissioner can assist with the process.  If you are not directly responsible for the re-charter process you can help.  Every adult must have a current youth protection training card.   Everyone needs to pay their membership fees.  Don't wait, get started now!   <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/re-charter-checklist">Recharter Checklist</a></strong></p>

<p>Election day is Tuesday November 8th.   Boy Scout Roundtable, OA Chapter Meeting and Venturing Forum would normally be held on that date.  For November only, these events will move to Thursday November 10th at the same location.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Roundtable</strong></p>

<p>Join Cub Scout Roundtable on Thursday November 10, 2016 at 7pm in room 211 at the First United Methodist Church in Richardson. Our topic is how to do flag ceremonies. Pack 728 will be joining us for the opening flag ceremony. If you want to bring your Cub Scouts and have them learn with the adults, this would be a perfect event. We will have a fun snack for adults and scouts to create together. The meeting will last only one hour but will be packed full of fun for all ages.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable & Venturing Forum</strong></p>

<p>High Adventure trips.
They're a big undertaking and sometimes just 
a little too far out-of-reach especially for short term plans.  
What to do?  How do we deliver a quality and memorable experience 
when the Big 4 BSA High Adventure camps are not a viable option?  
You can find an answer to questions like this one and get some great 
recommendations on optional adventures at your next Roundtable meeting.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 10th. 7:00 PM First United Methodist Church in Richardson 
2nd Floor of the Educational Building Located on the South bound side of Highway 75 (a.k.a. Central Expressway) between Arapaho Rd. and Belt Line Rd. We're saving a seat for you!  <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/high-adventure-trips">More information</a>  </p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/event-youth-protection-training-adults-f2f-ypt">Face to Face Youth Protection Training</a>  , Tuesday November 15, 2016</a>  </strong></p>

<p>November 15th, 7:00 to 9:00 PM you are invited to take face-to-face Youth Protection Training (F2F YPT) at Spring Creek Elementary. It could not be more convenient! This training is REQUIRED for adults who will participate in overnight scouting events that are 3 or more nights long. It is also HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all adults who participate in scouting events or weekend campouts. Yes, you can take YPT online, but that will not meet all of the requirements, so bottom line is that this face-to-face session will satisfy ALL YPT requirements for TWO YEARS.  <a href="ttp://northerntrail.circleten.org/event-youth-protection-training-adults-f2f-ypt">More information</a>   </p>
