<p>Both the Boy Scouts of American and the State of Texas are committed to protecting our youth. As adult scouters we must be in full compliance with both groups. New requirements from National means that all registered adult scouters must take the updated on-line training by October 1, 2018. Please see the <a href="http://circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/new_ypt2_update_quick_facts.pdf">Quick Facts</a> for more detailed information.</p>
 
<p>This does not replace F2F, but is in <span style="font-weight:bold;">addition</span> to F2F if that is the only training you receive for YPT.  As you know, F2F is required for any long-term camp (more than 72 hours).</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><img align="right" src="">Hazardous Weather Training</strong></p>
<p>Scouting is committed to safety and weather safety is of particular importance in our area. Effective <strong>April 30th, 2018</strong>, new direct contact leaders must complete Hazardous Weather Training to be considered position trained.  This includes, Cubmasters, Den Leader
Webelos Den Leaders, Scoutmasters, LDS leaders of 11-year olds, Crew Advisors, Ship Skippers and Post Advisors</p>
<p>This is the NEW training, numbered SCO_800.  You will no longer be considered Trained if you have not completed this training before May 1.  It is also a requirement for all camp staff as part of the NCAP standards SQ-402.</p>
<p>To take the course go to <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a> and log-in to your account. Create an account if you don’t already have one.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><img align="right" hspace="5" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/eagle.png#overlay-context=calendar-events"><strong>Troop 2054 Eagle Scouts Recognized by the Mayor of Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Troop 2054 held an Eagle Court of Honor at the UT Dallas School of Management on April 15, 2018 to recognize its four Eagle Scouts - Suhaib Shah, Mikael Rafiqi, Muhammed Qasim Rahman, and Muhammad Irtaza Ikram.   The event was attended by many from Northern Trail District Leadership, including District Chairman, Asst District Commissioner, Membership Chair, and the OA Chair.  Chuck Holden, the District Asst Commissioner, administered the Eagle Charge, whereas Steve Bloberger, the District Chairman, took the Eagle Oath from the four scouts.  The Mayor of Richardson could not attend the event due to a travel to the nation's capital, but sent a special written message to the Troop 2054 on how proud the city of Richardson is of the Eagle scouts and it expects them to give back to their communities as model citizens serving as role models to others.  The Mayor also sent separate commendation letters to the four Eagle scouts.   A picture of the four Eagle scouts is available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9iwabdq2x8jo7ai/ecoh_041518.JPG?dl=0">here</a></p><p style="font-size:18px;"><img src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/csx_logo.png" align="right" hspace="5"><strong><a href="http://circleten.org/CTX2">Circle Ten Xperience 2018 (CTX2)!</a></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friends of Scouting</strong></p>
<p>Everyone can help make scouting a financial success.  Even a small amount  makes a difference.  Northern Trail is falling behind other districts and has only achieved about 45% of our goal.</p>
<p>Please consider the value of scouting to our community. Both the volunteer labor and the financial support come from our local community and we don't receive any funds from National.</p>
<p>Don't put it off any longer, if you've already made a pledge this year, <b>Thank You.</b> If you have not, just go to <a href="http://circleten.org/give-now">http://circleten.org/give-now</a> and click the Donate button. <span style="color:black; font-weight:900;font-style:italic;">When you get to the donation screen, be sure and identify your gift in the "Note" field. For example "Northern Trail Troop 9999."</span> Scouting works because of you!</p>
