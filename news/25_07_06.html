While many events focus on Webelos crossing over into a troop, don't forget about the fall season. It's an excellent opportunity to connect with middle schoolers and older youth who haven't yet experienced the program. We've compiled some helpful tips and strategies that you can implement immediately to reach these families. Join us at this year's National Scouts BSA Fall Membership Kickoff event, where we'll share these insights. Attendees will leave energized and equipped with effective tools to support their council’s recruitment efforts this Fall. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.7em; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Scoutmaster Minute – Hazardous Weather Preparedness</p></strong>
    <p>Scouts, Scouters, and families—</p>
    <p>We talk a lot in Scouting about being prepared. But what does that really mean when we’re out in the woods and the sky starts to darken?</p>
    <p><strong>In response to the recent tragedy in Central Texas due to flash floods</strong>, it’s more important than ever to understand the importance of preparedness.</p>
    <p><strong>Hazardous Weather Training</strong> isn’t just a rule—it’s part of living up to our promise to keep Scouts safe. It teaches us how to recognize danger before it strikes, how to act quickly, and how to protect one another in storms, extreme heat, and other weather challenges.</p>
    <p>A thunderstorm doesn’t care if we’re halfway through a hike. A sudden flood won’t wait for us to pack up camp. But if we’ve done the training, stayed alert, and worked together, we’ll be ready.</p>
    <p>So let’s remember: <strong>being prepared isn’t just a motto—it’s a mindset</strong>. Whether you’re a Scout or an adult leader, take time to learn the skills that could make all the difference.</p>
    <p><em>Because in Scouting, safety isn’t luck. It’s leadership.</em></p>

<p style="clear:left;">The Richardson Rotary Club is searching for a scout troop in the Richardson area that would like to help them with their Flag Program.
