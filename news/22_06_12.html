<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">A Scouting Prayer</strong></p>
<p>During our recent adult recognition event during Twilight Camp, Joe Tavares gave the invocation. I believe this particular prayer addresses many of the things we hope for in scouting. Joe provided me a copy to share.</p>
<div style="margin-left:25px; margin-right:25px;">
<p style="font-weight:600"><i>Eternal God, build me Scouts who will be strong enough to know when they are weak and brave enough to face themselves when afraid – Scouts who will be proud and unbending in honest defeat, and humble and gentle in victory... Build me Scouts whose wishes will not take the place of deeds –Scouts who are the foundation stone of knowledge...</i></p>
<p style="font-weight:600"><i>Lead these Scouts, I pray, not in the path of ease and comfort, but with the stress and spur of difficulty and challenge so they may learn to stand up in the storm and learn compassion for those who fail...</i></p>
<p style="font-weight:600"><i>Build Scouts whose heart will be clear and whose goals will be high. Scouts who will master themselves before they seek to master others, who will march into the future, yet never forget the past...</i></p>
<p style="font-weight:600"><i>And after all these things are theirs, add enough of a sense of humor so that they may always be serious, but never take themselves too seriously. Give them humility, so that they may always remember the simplicity of true wisdom, and the meekness of true strength...
Let us, as Scouters, recognize these traits as good and honest and let us strive to prepare these Scouts in the examples we set.</i></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Adult Awards Dinner</strong></p>
<p>The adult awards dinner was held at Twilight Camp last Tuesday evening. We recognized Y.E.S., District Award of Merit, Robert E. Little and Silver Beaver award recipients. Due to an oversight, Trey Otte who received the Silver Beaver was left off the program. We apologize for the error. You can find the program <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/documents/program_2022.pdf">here</a>.</p> 

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Eagle Candidates, Please Note </strong></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Popcorn Sale</strong></p>
<p>Don't forget this is a vital part of funding for council and a great way for units to earn money for expenses.  Units can earn an additional 2% commission by attending a popcorn kickoff. The calendar and kickoff registrations can be found <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/106671/calendar-and-kickoff">here.</a> Sign up now <a href="">here.</a></p>

<p>Membership is a year-round activity. Don't jeopardize the future of your unit by failing to attract new members. Those who came before you made your unit possible. Consider the future scouts who will benefit from their experience in scouting.</p>

<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p> 
<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>
<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p>
