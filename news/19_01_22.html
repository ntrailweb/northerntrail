<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-2019">Scouting for Food Bags Now Available</a></strong></p>

<p>Bags go out Saturday February 16th, 2019 and pickup is Saturday February 23rd.</p>
<p>Attention All SFF Unit Chairs!</p>
<p>I now have our SFF bags on my front porch at 926 Wedgewood Way in Richardson. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yLMocDfta7U2">Map</a></p>
<p>Please send a representative from your unit by and pick up only what you will need.</p>
<p>In previous years we ran out of bags before all units got them. Each full box contains 1000 bags.</p>
<p>Our community needs your help and service. We still have many areas available for you to serve.</p>
<p>Available areas may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/scouting-food-areas">Here</a>, Please sign up by contacting me at 
<a href="mailto:hmiller002.tx@gmail.com">hmiller002.tx@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, February has been deemed “Do A Good Turn” month. Sign up for an area today. If your unit is not participating this year, please ask "why not?"</p>

<p>Yours in Scouting,</p>
