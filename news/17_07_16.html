<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>EAGLE PALM Requirements are Changing</strong></p>
<p>There is a good <a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2017/07/10/changes-to-eagle-palms/">article</a> in the online Scouting Magazine that came out this week about the new Eagle Palm requirements.  Click on the link to read it.</p>
<p>With this change, a boy who completes his Eagle Board of Review on or after Aug 1, 2017, automatically receives all the palms that he is entitled to as of his Eagle BOR with his Eagle advancement instead of after.  For example, if a boy has 30 merit badges prior to his Eagle BOR, he receives his Eagle badge with Bronze palm as of his Eagle BOR date.  If he receives another MB the following day, he is entitled to a Gold palm 3 months after his Eagle BOR.</p>
<p>Other key changes in Palm requirements take effect at the same time.  See the article for details.<ul>
<li>A BOR is no longer required for additional palms.</li>
<li>The definition of "Active" has been expanded beyond Troop & Patrol.</li>
<li>The Leadership requirement has been expanded to include additional options.</li>
<li>The Tenure between each additional palm remains at 3 months.<br />
   This means that a scout with 30 MBs at his Eagle BOR gets a Bronze immediately.  If he receives 6 more the following month, then he is eligible for a Gold palm 3 months after his Eagle BOR and his Silver palm 3 months after that.</li></ul></p>
