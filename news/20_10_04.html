<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection Training is Required</strong></p>
<p>As an adult you <span style="font-weight:bold;">cannot participate</span> in any scouting activity in-person or on-line unless you have a current Youth Protection Card. These expire every two years and because of changes two years ago, most of us need new cards. This includes Venturing scouts who are 18 years of age or older.</p>
<p>Your unit re-charter <span style="font-weight:bold;">cannot be completed</span> until every member has a current card. Avoid the rush, get it done today.</p>
<p>YPT is designed to protect not only our scouts, but adult volunteers. It's vital that everyone understand the critical concepts and procedures which keep everyone safe. Just because someone might not be interacting in person, does not change the <span style="font-weight:bold;">requirement</span> that all adults have a <span style="font-weight:bold;">valid current YPT card</span>. Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> to take the training. Only takes about an hour.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">School Night For Scouting</strong></p>

The Boy Scouts of America is unique in that local organizations are given charters to use the program-Cub Scouts, ScoutsBSA, Venturing, or Sea Scouts. Existing units are chartered for a one year period from January 1 to December 31. It is now time for Northern Trail units to begin the re-charter process and unit leaders should have received letter last month with instructions and log on information. The first step in re-chartering is go online and review your unit’s membership information. For more information about how to re-charter there will be a clinic offered as part of October’s Roundtable, on Thursday, October 8. 
If you have not received your unit’s re-charter information and log on information, please contact your unit commissioner, our District Commissioner, Hank Voegtle <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a> , or Rachel Joslyn <a href="mailto:Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org">Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org</a>, our Senior District Executive.</p>
<p>Please don't wait to start working on your unit Re-charter. Everyone has a role, complete your YPT and needed paperwork. Unit leaders get your code and start the process of getting your records synchronized. Avoid the rush, get started today! Here is a checklist to help you get started: <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/re-charter-checklist.html">Checklist.</a></p>
<p>Venturers (aged 18-20) must have completed an adult registration form and the attached Background Check forms, position code VP, and complete Youth Protection Training prior to the re-charter to remain in the crew as Youth Participants. They are still youth, but because they are 18 or older, they must complete YPT and have the background checks completed. Start now and avoid the rush.</p> 
<p>Don't panic, if you need help, contact your <a style="font-weight:bold;" style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> or Hank Voegtle <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a> </p>

<strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Recruiting New Scouts</strong></p>
<p>Now is the time to recruit new members. COVID makes even short-term planning challenging, but Circle Ten and the Northern Trail membership committee are working to make it successful. Remember with new scouts come new parents who are creative and enthusiastic. Materials to help you are available at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources</a>.

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Religious Relationships Committee</strong></p>
<p>Where and when was the first documented Thanksgiving in what is now the United States? Plymouth in 1621, Virginia in 1619, Texas in 1598, or Florida in 1564? Taking time out of our daily activities and reflect on our blessings is a spiritual theme around the world. As you celebrate Thanksgiving this year, join the Circle Ten Religious Relationships Committee to reflect on Thanksgiving and how it relates to the Scout Oath and Law. Details will be announced soon.</p>
 
 <p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Leadership Training for Scouts</strong></p>
 <P>ILST, Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops is the BSA course to help Scouts learn how to become effective leaders. This course has replaced Oak Leaf and is to be presented at the troop level.</p>
<p>We will not have a district led course this fall, but hope to offer one this spring. Scouts learn about their roles in the PLC and how to run effective troop and patrol meetings. ILST is a prerequisite for NYLT. Information on this course for Scoutmasters is available. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/documents/ILST_guide.pdf">here.</a></p> <p>For more information, contact Dory Petsrillo, Training Chair. <a href="mailto:dlmp616@gmail.com">dlmp616@gmail.com</a></p>
 
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Position Training</strong></p>
<p>Adults in leadership positions, Den leaders, Cubmasters, Scoutmasters and Crew Advisers must be position trained. Please make plans to get trained. In addition to specific training for your position, hazardous weather training is required. </p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">Popcorn</a></strong></p>
<p>Does your unit need to sign-up for the 2020 popcorn sale? Here are some incentives, if a Scout sells $250 dollars in popcorn they can attend day camp/winter camp for free or $100 dollars off an in-council camp. Click here for more popcorn reward information. For more information please contact Rachel Joslyn at <a href="mailto:Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org">Rachel.Joslyn@scouting.org</a>.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has put a significant financial strain on the council. Popcorn sales is a big part of the income stream for the council and it helps units raise money for their programs and scout accounts. The popcorn program has adapted to the new normal and there are innovative ways to sell. Check out the details and get <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">signed</a> up today.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Revised COVID-19 Rules for Advancement</strong>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Extension of Time for Eagle Rank</span> - Earlier this year, National allowed councils to grant a 3 month extension to complete the Eagle requirements when inability to meet the requirements by the 18th birthday was caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. NEW: National has now allowed Councils to grant an additional 3 month extension under the same guidelines. This authority is currently set to expire on Dec 31, 2020.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Swimming</span> - Second Class (5b) and First Class (6a) swimming requirements may be deferred until each Scout’s next rank, as necessary (through Life, but not Eagle). In other words. a scout may advance up to Life by deferring these requirements until the Scout's first advancement after National reinstates these requirements. For that next advancement, the scout must pass any of these deferred requirements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Camping Merit Badge</span> - Requirement 9b is temporarily suspended (not deferred) until National restores it after the COVID-19 emergency. All other requirements, including camping nights, must be met to earn the Camping MB.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Can Merit Badge Requirements be Adapted</span> - Leaders and merit badge counselors must not make additions or deletions to requirements. The Scout is expected to meet the requirements as stated; in some cases, virtual “visits” may fulfill the intent of a requirement. When the requirement’s intent cannot be reached virtually, the requirements cannot be completed, and the Scout must wait to complete that badge/requirement. Merit badge counselors signing off on requirements must determine to the best of their ability if the Scout has demonstrated the intended outcome.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
