Council Annual Recognition Banquet</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Event has been rescheduled for Tuesday, May 19th.</p>
<p>We have moved the council banquet to Tuesday, May 19th. It will be at the same time at the same location. As of this time, the council banquet is still on.</p>
<p>We have implemented a few changes for this year to further ensure the health of all who attend our event. The Plano Event Center is also taking steps to follow enhanced health and safety guidelines and recommendations and we feel confident in moving forward with our event.</p>
<p>All who are currently registered for the event will remain registered. The deadline has passed to receive a full refund for your cancelation. Still, I would appreciate your notification should you know you or members of your party will not attend. You may also contact me to substitute the name of one of your paid guests. We will address cancelations starting next week and will determine how many spots become available. There will be room for people who were not able to register before. If you would like to join the waiting list to attend the banquet, please notify Leigh Anne LeBlanc, the council banquet chair, at <a href="mailto:leighcat3@gmail.com">leighcat3@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>We will keep you posted on the status of the event. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and your guests. As Scouters, we must do our part to protect the community and our families.</p>
