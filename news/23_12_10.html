<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Holiday Gift Giving</strong></a></p>
<p>This time of year, we often think about gift giving.  Scouting is a gift to our children and to the adult volunteers.  Scouts benefit from life and skills training.  This includes the opportunity to observe adult leaders who freely give their time, talent, and treasure.  Setting a good example through actions is far more effective than simply telling scouts what they should do.
Adult volunteers benefit from the experience as well.  The satisfaction arising from making a difference is a good feeling.  Additionally adult leaders enjoy the camaraderie of the other leaders who have similar values, but different skills and experiences.  They become better parents and leaders as a result.</p>
<p>The greatest gift we can give our children is our time and attention.  Scouting offers the opportunity to spend quality time with our children but also demonstrates to them that we value the program enough to allocate the needed time.</p>
<p>Resolve to spend more quality scouting time with your scout by your active participation in your unit. Attending campouts, meetings and helping the leadership with activities.  This will be a gift not only to the scouts, but for yourself as well.</p>
<p>You can give a gift to an outstanding volunteer in your unit by nominating them for an <a href="https://ntrail.org/adult-recognition-0.html"><strong>award</strong></a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Re-charter</p>
<p>Time is running out. If still not complete, please get it completed as soon as possible. If your unit leadership is scrambling to get it done, please do your part by completing any necessary training or paperwork today.  Late re-charters are hard on everyone.</p>
<p>If you need assistance, help is available. Your unit commissioner or the district executive will be happy to answer any questions about the process.  The details of how to get it done may be found <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Please don't let your charter lapse. Your scouts depend on you to get it done and keep your unit functioning.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Friends of Scouting</strong></a></p>

<p>We know that times are difficult, and many organizations are asking for support this time of year.  We can't escape the fact that for scouting to thrive, we must have three essential elements.  First, we need scouts who want to participate because they enjoy the program.  These scouts will not fully appreciate the benefit of scouting until they are adults.  We have no shortage of eager youth who want to experience the adventure of scouting.   Next, we need dedicated volunteers and professionals who will deliver the promise of scouting through their efforts.  These leaders need the necessary resources to deliver the program.  Finally, we need funding to pay for camps, activities, administration, program materials and compensation for the professionals.  While popcorn sales, camp cards and fees help, a major fraction of the funds needed to support scouting come from the community.</p>
<p>No organization is perfect, but scouting is much more efficient with resources and dollars than most other similar groups.  The resulting dividends will be in terms of youth exposed to the scouting experience.  They will go on to become productive citizens, parents, and employees.  The scout oath and law will become part of their psyche for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Please, when you are asked to pledge your support to scouting, remember the direct and indirect benefits to our children and the community. Unit leaders, please help by scheduling an FOS presentation at your next Blue and Gold or Court of Honor. Contact Kristine Schwope <a href="mailto:kschwope@hotmail.com"><strong>kschwope@hotmail.com</strong></a> to arrange a presentation.</p>
<p>All of us can contribute even if it's a small amount.  Your support ensures that scouting continues to thrive.  Scouting works!</p>

<p>If you wish you may give online <a href="https://donations.scouting.org/#/council/571/appeal/15"><strong>here</strong></a>, be sure and select Northern Trail District in the district field.</p>
