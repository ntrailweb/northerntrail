<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Failure by Design!</strong></p>
<p>Having things go wrong is a powerful learning experience. A scout unit is designed to be boy led. One quickly recognizes that putting an 11 to 17 year old in charge of an activity will be problematic. This in fact is by design! As adult leaders we are there to advise, monitor and intervene when the situation warrants, but many times the best approach is to allow scouts to fail! Yes, fail! Many times as adults we feel compelled to jump in, assert control, organize and point out obvious errors. In most cases we need to stand on the sidelines and watch. Sometimes we do need to ask questions and prod a bit, but leadership is about dealing with the consequences of actions or inactions. A poorly planned meeting or campout may result in some problems, but the experience of dealing with these problems will enlighten your scouts much more than having someone else deal with the problems. If scouts plan a meal on their own and then see the adults eating a great meal while they are eating beans, it will make an impression. As adults it can be very difficult to allow our scouts to fail, but if we protect them from every problem, they will fail to learn how to deal with failures and how to turn them into a success.</p>

<p>As an adult leader, keep in mind that one of the methods of the program is allowing scouts to lead. When they lead they will learn from their failures. Don't deny them this powerful opportunity.</p>
