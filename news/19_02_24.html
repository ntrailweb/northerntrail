<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Friends of Scouting (FOS)</strong></p>
<p>Scouting needs youth, volunteers and funding. Without all of these elements, the program cannot function. Funding for programs, camps and professional staff come from the local community. A very large fraction of this funding comes from families in scouting. We must communicate this important message to scouting parents across the district. Unit Leaders your help is needed, please make room at your next court of honor or Blue and Gold for a volunteer to make the case for supporting scouting in our community. Contact Marie. Baert <a href="mailto:marie.baert@verizon.net">marie.baert@verizon.net</a> to make the arrangements.</p>
