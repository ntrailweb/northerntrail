<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Alan Edwards</strong><img src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/default/files/media/district/nt/alan_edwards_0.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></p>
<p>We are saddened to report the passing of scouter Alan Edwards. Alan was an adult volunteer in Troop 1191 and a dedicated district volunteer. He tirelessly promoted scouting through several local media outlets with stories and pictures about scouting in the district. A memorial service will be held Saturday, July 20, 11:00 AM at First Baptist Church, Dallas in Truitt Chapel. More information will be posted when it is available.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Unit Finances and Fund Raising</strong></p>
<p>All scout units will have expenses and you will need to raise the needed money, produce a budget, pay the bills and have the needed cash to meet the obligations when they are due. A unit can raise money in several ways, this includes dues, popcorn sales and camp cards. It's important to keep dues as low as possible to avoid excluding scouts who might not have the resources. Just the cost of uniforms and equipment can be challenging and adding high dues can be a deal breaker. Even though financial aid may be available, not every family is willing to accept help. Having scouts participate in the process of raising funds helps instill self-reliance and financial literacy.</p>
<p>Units can raise money in other ways, but the council sponsored programs have the added benefit of helping the council defray costs which is important because we depend on camps, services and council personnel to make the program work. No approvals are required, and these programs work well. You can embark on other fund-raising activities, but these need to be approved by the district executive. This is done by filling out an <a href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/34427.pdf">application</a> and get it approved in advance. If you have questions, contact your unit commissioner or the district executive.</p>
