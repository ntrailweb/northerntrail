<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>National Council News</strong></p>
<p>As was reported on Monday, the National BSA filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. You can help counteract all the negative publicity and misinformation by sharing the following items with your units. Here is a sharable <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/default/files/media/district/nt/things_to_know.pdf">graphic</a> which describes the details of what is happening. More detailed information may be found <a href="https://www.bsarestructuring.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that this bankruptcy will not affect us locally as members of Circle Ten Council. We remain as strong and dedicated as always to deliver this great <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/default/files/media/district/nt/year_in_scouting.pdf">program</a> to our youth. It is more important than ever that everyone support our council through Friends of Scouting now to keep us that way.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Camp Cards</strong></p>
<p>Selling Camp Cards is a great way for your Scouts to help fund their way to camp or to help fund any of the unit activities you may have planned for the year. Cards will be sold for $10 each this year and your unit still earns 50% commission for every card sold! We are happy to announce our partnership with Albertsons-Tom Thumb grocery stores for our 2020 Camp Card Campaign!</p>
<p>Unit leaders, register through Campmaster today. <a href="https://circle10.camp-master.com/ulRequestReservationv5.aspx?id=1678">Register here</a> and plan on attending one of the two kickoff events, one will be held on <span style="font-weight:bold;">February 26, 7:00 p.m.</span> at the council office, 8605 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75235 and the other at Ridgewood Park UMC, 6445 E Lovers Lane, Dallas, TX 75214 on <span style="font-weight:bold;">February 27, 7:00 p.m</span>.<br />
