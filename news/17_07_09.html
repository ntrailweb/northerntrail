<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Training Does Make a Difference</strong></p>
<p>Ever watched a professional complete a complex task seemingly effortlessly? Sure you have! All of us have experienced that knowing how do to something makes all the difference.</p><p>Sometimes we think we know how scouting works or we think the problem is so simple that we can figure it out easily.</p>
<p>To begin with the scout program is much more subtle than most of us realize. Beginning with the AIMs and continuing into the methods of the program the implementation is not intuitive. In fact it is counterintuitive!</p>
<p>Those of us who have been involved in scouting for a long time know that the key to success is training.</p>
<p>If you want your child and to be successful in scouts, you need to get training. Training is intended for every parent and not just adults who have leadership positions.</p>
<p>Let me repeat; If you want your scout to get the most from scouting, <strong>invest in training!</strong></p>
<p>Training for the fall will begin soon. The first opportunity will be Boy Scout Specific training begins on Wednesday evening October 4th.  A day of training will be held on Saturday October 14th. Save the dates and watch the website for more information on these  and other training opportunities coming in the fall.</p>
