<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>COVID-19 Response</strong></p>
<strong><p>We are in a period where the nation has severely curtailed most non-essential activity while we flatten the infection curve. This takes time and as time goes by, we will have a better understanding of where we are and what must be done to deal with the current situation. How long this will take is unknown.</p>
<p>The important thing to keep in mind is that we can adapt and work within the constraints placed on us. Units can meet using technology and as the situation improves with new procedures designed to protect participants, in-person activities will resume.</p>
<p>Keep planning upcoming events and consider ways to achieve scouting goals while working within the realities we are facing today and in the future.</p>
<p>Watch for updates from the council as the situation evolves.</p></strong>

Council Annual Recognition Banquet</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Event has been rescheduled for May 19th.</span><br />
<p>You may have already read the message from Circle Ten stating that all council activities are forced to be cancelled through March 31st. That includes the council banquet. While we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, we do support efforts to keep our community safe and to protect our guests’ health. We have moved the council banquet to Tuesday, May 19th. It will be at the same time at the same location.</p>
<p>We have implemented a few changes for this year to further ensure the health of all who attend our event, and we will keep those changes for our new date. The Plano Event Center is also taking steps to follow enhanced health and safety guidelines and recommendations and we feel confident in moving forward with our event.</p>
<p>All who are currently registered for the event will remain registered. You are responsible for informing each of your guests of the new event date. It is important that you reach out to each of your guests registered through you and confirm their availability. If you are the main contact for your registration, you are the only contact we have. If there are those in your registration who cannot attend, please contact Leigh Anne LeBlanc at leighcat3@gmail.com. We will be moving forward with preparations and we still need to give the Plano Event Center an accurate number. For those guests who are not able to attend on the new date, we will issue a full refund if you contact us by April 1st. After April 1st, any who have not replied that they cannot attend on May 19 will not receive a refund.</p>
<p>Depending on how many cannot attend the banquet on the new date, there may be room for people who were not able to register before. We will keep you posted. 
Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and your guests. As Scouters, we must do our part to protect the community and our families.</p>
