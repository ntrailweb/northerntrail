<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Youth Protection Training is Required</strong></p>
<p>There have been some problems reported with <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>.  As of right now the system is working.  Sometimes it gets busy.  If you have forgotten your user ID and or password, there is a recovery process you can go through.  This works even if your email has changed.  Just be sure and have your BSA id number.</p>

<p>Many in Northern Trail lack current YPT cards.  Two years ago a new system was implemented and everyone who took the training then will need to take it again.   As an adult you <span style="font-weight:bold;">cannot participate</span> in any scouting activity in-person or on-line unless you have a current Youth Protection Card.  These expire every two years and because of changes two years ago, most of us need new cards.  This includes Venturing scouts who are 18 years of age or older.</p>
<p>Your unit re-charter <span style="font-weight:bold;">cannot be completed</span> until every member has a current card.  Avoid the rush, get it done today.</p>
<p>YPT is designed to protect not only our scouts, but adult volunteers.  It's vital that everyone understand the critical concepts and procedures which keep everyone safe.  Just because someone might not be interacting in person, does not change the <span style="font-weight:bold;">requirement</span> that all adults have a <span style="font-weight:bold;">valid current YPT card</span>.  Please take the time now to get current.  Go to <a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> to take the training.  Only takes about an hour.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2020NTALSIOLS">ALT / IOLS Training</a></strong></p>
<p>Training starts on <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday of this week</span> via Zoom.   This training is for Leaders in the ScoutsBSA program and is targeted at leaders and parents who want to learn the details of how a troop operates.  Emphasis is placed on Scout-Led activities and how to manage troop meetings and campouts.  You learn by taking on the role of a scout and learn the ropes just as the scouts do in an actual unit.  It's a fun rewarding activity and you will meet other scouting adults who are facing the same challenges.   The Adult Leader Specific or ALT portion of the program will be done using Zoom and meets twice.  The first meeting is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, September 30th at 7:00PM</span> and the second session is the following <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday October 7th at 7:00PM</span>.  <p><strong>Introduction to Outdoor Leaders Skills</strong> is an actual scout campout over the weekend of <span style="font-weight:bold;">October 17th and 18th</span> at Camp Wisdom.  The campout planning will be a part of the ALT training.   To be considered "trained" you need to complete both ALT and the IOLS.</p>
<p>Registration is required.   <a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2020NTALSIOLS">Registration now available.</a></p> 

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">School Night For Scouting</strong></p>
<p>School night for scouting is underway and every unit needs to participate.  This weeks events: </strong> <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://ntrail.org/snfs.htm">9/28, 9/29 & 10/1</a></strong>.  Most scouts are recruited in the fall and we can't miss this opportunity.  New scouts are the lifeblood of the scouting movement.  These new scouts will benefit from scouting, but older scouts will benefit as well with the opportunity to learn leadership skills by leading these new scouts.  In addition from the ranks new scouts come adults who will be the future leaders of your unit. Without these leaders your unit will not thrive and survive.  Future generations of scouts are depending on your actions today recruiting new scouts.</p>

<p><img align="right" hspace="5" src="https://ntrail.org/images/join_cub_scouts.jpg">
<strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Recruiting New Scouts</strong></p>
<p>Now is the time to recruit new members. COVID makes even short-term planning challenging, but Circle Ten and the Northern Trail membership committee are working to make it successful. Remember with new scouts come new parents who are creative and enthusiastic.  Materials to help you are available at <a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources</a>. There is an order form link on that page where you can order Cub Scout Business Cards, Scouts BSA Business Cards, Door Hangers (Cub Specific), Sticky Notes (Cub Specific), Yard Sign for families (Cub only), Yard Sign for the community (Generic Join Scouting), and customized videos which will include things such as your unit, a contact with phone and/or email, a date for a meeting, etc. Every Scouting family should have a yard sign, either Cub Specific or generic. Yard signs will demonstrate that Scouting is thriving in Northern Trail.  Please contact Membership Chair Bram Franklin to coordinate, ask questions or address concerns at (214)-609-9089 or <a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com">bramfranklin@gmail.com</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-charter</strong></p>
<p>Please don't wait to start working on your unit Re-charter.  Everyone has a role, complete your YPT and needed paperwork.  Unit leaders get your code and start the process of getting your records synchronized.  Avoid the rush, get started today!  Here is a checklist to help you get started: <a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="https://www.ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist.html">Checklist.</a></p>
<p>Venturers (aged 18-20) must have completed an adult registration form and the attached Background Check forms, position code VP, and complete Youth Protection Training prior to the re-charter to remain in the crew as Youth Participants.  They are still youth, but because they are 18 or older, they must complete YPT and have the background checks completed.  Start now and avoid the rush.</p> 
<p>Re-charter login codes should have been received by now.   The Chartered Organization Representative and / or the unit Committee Chair should have them. If not received by the end of the month, see your <a style="font-weight:bold;"  style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> for the code.</p>

<p>Don't panic, if you need help, contact your <a style="font-weight:bold;"  style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> or Hank Voegtle <a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a> </p>

 <P>ILST, Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops is the BSA course to help Scouts learn how to become effective leaders.  This course has replaced Oak Leaf and is to be presented at the troop level.</p>
<p>We will not have a district led course this fall, but hope to offer one this spring.   Scouts learn about their roles in the PLC and how to run effective troop and patrol meetings.  ILST is a prerequisite  for NYLT.  Information on this course for Scoutmasters is available.  <a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="https://ntrail.org/documents/ILST_guide.pdf">here.</a></p> <p>For more information, contact Dory Petsrillo, Training Chair.  <a style="font-weight:bold" href="mailto:dlmp616@gmail.com">dlmp616@gmail.com</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Revised COVID-19 Rules for Advancement</strong>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Extension of Time for Eagle Rank</span> - Earlier this year, National allowed councils to grant a 3 month extension to complete the Eagle requirements when inability to meet the requirements by the 18th birthday was caused by the COVID-19 epidemic.  NEW: National has now allowed Councils to grant an additional 3 month extension under the same guidelines.  This authority is currently set to expire on Dec 31, 2020.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Swimming</span> -  Second Class (5b) and First Class (6a) swimming requirements may be deferred until each Scout’s next rank, as necessary (through Life, but not Eagle).  In other words. a scout may advance up to Life by deferring these requirements until the Scout's first advancement after National reinstates these requirements.  For that next advancement, the scout must pass any of these deferred requirements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Camping Merit Badge</span> - Requirement 9b is temporarily suspended (not deferred) until National restores it after the COVID-19 emergency.  All other requirements, including camping nights, must be met to earn the Camping MB.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Can Merit Badge Requirements be Adapted</span> -  Leaders and merit badge counselors must not make additions or deletions to requirements. The Scout is expected to meet the requirements as stated; in some cases, virtual “visits” may fulfill the intent of a requirement. When the requirement’s intent cannot be reached virtually, the requirements cannot be completed, and the Scout must wait to complete that badge/requirement. Merit badge counselors signing off on requirements must determine to the best of their ability if the Scout has demonstrated the intended outcome.</p>
<p>To request this extension, email the following information to the District Advancement Chair, Bob Faulkner <a style="font-weight:bold" href="mailto:b.c.faulkner@att.net">b.c.faulkner@att.net</a>
<ul>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
