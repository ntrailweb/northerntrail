<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable</strong> Tuesday, May 8th 7:00PM</p>
<p>Our May 8th Boy Scout Roundtable subject is Radio Merit Badge and Jamboree on the Air. The 2017 devastating storms in the Caribbean Islands left people in the remote areas without communications. Ham radio operators were placed in these areas. They became the only source of information about the people who did or did not survived as well as being the only connection for emergency help. Find out more about the purpose of Ham Radio and how interested Scouts and Scouters can learn more about becoming an amateur radio operator. Our guest speaker will be from either the Plano Amateur Radio Klub or the Richardson Wireless Klub. We are expecting an informative and entertaining presentation. Please join us.

<p>Both the Boy Scouts of American and the State of Texas are committed to protecting our youth. As adult scouters we must be in full compliance with both groups. New requirements from National means that all registered adult scouters must take the updated on-line training by October 1, 2018. Please see the <a href="http://circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/new_ypt2_update_quick_facts.pdf">Quick Facts</a> for more detailed information.</p>
 
<p>This does not replace F2F, but is in <span style="font-weight:bold;">addition</span> to F2F if that is the only training you receive for YPT. As you know, F2F is required for any long-term camp (more than 72 hours).</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><img align="right" src="">Hazardous Weather Training</strong></p>
<p>Scouting is committed to safety and weather safety is of particular importance in our area. Effective <strong>April 30th, 2018</strong>, new direct contact leaders must complete Hazardous Weather Training to be considered position trained. This includes, Cubmasters, Den Leader
Webelos Den Leaders, Scoutmasters, LDS leaders of 11-year olds, Crew Advisors, Ship Skippers and Post Advisors</p>
<p>This is the NEW training, numbered SCO_800. You will no longer be considered Trained if you have not completed this training before May 1. It is also a requirement for all camp staff as part of the NCAP standards SQ-402.</p>
<p>To take the course go to <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a> and log-in to your account. Create an account if you don’t already have one.</p>

<p><strong>Finish Strong!</strong> We are coming to the end of the 2018 <strong>Friends of Scouting</strong> Fund Raising Campaign. Through the hard work of many volunteers we are doing well, but we have more to do. Friends of Scouting is a Council wide fund drive which contributes more than 30% of Circle Ten's budget. You can give a check made out to Circle Ten Council to your unit Chairman or Leader and they will pass it on to Council. Alternatively you can contribute online at <a href="http://circleten.org/give-now">http://circleten.org/give-now</a> - Just make sure to include in the note field "FOS, Northern Trail along with your unit number. Northern Trail Scouters have always recognized the value of scouting by contributing to the Friends of Scouting. Any amount will help! Let’s keep the tradition going. A volunteer will contact you in the next few weeks if we have not heard from you. Don't put it off any longer, if you've already made a pledge this year, <b>Thank You.</b></p>
