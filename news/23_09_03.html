<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Training is Essential</p>
<p>Read the instructions! Have you noticed that products today come with either no manual or limited instructions? This is probably because most consumers do not bother to read them. This is unfortunate, because in many cases we fail to make effective use of features we do not understand, furthermore we can even damage or shorten the life of the products.</p>
<p>Scouting is not well understood by most people and additionally many people have an incorrect understanding of the how, why, and what of scouting. Scouting is quite unique and the method to the madness is not always obvious.</p>
<p>Training helps leaders and parents understand the key concepts of scouting, which leads to better results, less workload, and less frustration.</p>
<p>Don't overlook training for scouts as well. ILST training is coming soon, details below.</p> 
<p>Basic Adult Outdoor Orientation <strong>BALOO</strong> is one of the required training elements for a Pack to do overnight Pack camping events. The Pack must have one leader with this training on any Pack camp out but it is recommended that Packs have several leaders with the training to make sure all Pack camp outs can be covered. Introduction Outdoor Leaader Skills <strong>IOLS</strong>, is required for Scoutmasters and Asst. Scoutmasters to be considered "Trained" in their position. 
<p>So, take the time to get trained and encourage parents to get trained as well. They will better understand the program and be more supportive of the front-line leaders.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Update on Recharter</p>
<p>Charter renewal will remain the same through the December 2023 recharter cycle and then, in March 2024 the unit renewal changes will be implemented. Note: <strong>this will impact your pack/troop dues</strong> in that your newly joined scouts will have already paid their recharter fee, <u>while existing scouts 2024 recharter fees will need to be collected</u>. 

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership + Recruiting</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>School Night for Scouting:</strong> So far, we’ve recruited 57 scouts into Northern Trail Packs! 910 new scouts across the council. At Circle 10, we’ve recruited more scouts in August than we did last year! Off to a good start.</li>


<li><strong>Retain New Members:</strong> Be sure and make a concerted effort to make new scouts and their parents feel welcome in your unit. Scouting can be a little overwhelming to new scouts and their parents. Meeting can be confusing and the AIM and Methods of scouting may not be obvious. Just a little effort will make a huge difference.</li>

<li><strong>Promotional Materials Available:</strong> Circle Ten Council is thrilled to be able to provide you with materials to assist with your fall recruiting efforts. Click here to order supplies! (Door hangers, business cards, bookmarks, yard signs, etc.) More information <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/82836/membership-resources"><strong>here.</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Changes To Cub Scout Pack Overnight Camping</p>
<p>Effective Sept. 1, 2023, Cub Scout packs who are conducting their own overnight camping activity may now camp up to two consecutive nights. Cub Scout packs who are conducting their own overnight camping activities must continue to have at least one registered adult leader who is trained in Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation (BALOO), oversees the planning and is in attendance for the pack campout. This updated policy also applies to Webelos and Arrow of Light dens who may conduct den coordinated campouts. The policy will be updated in the Guide to Safe Scouting and other resources on Sept. 1. An updated version of the BALOO training will also be released at this time.</p>
<p>NOTE: All Circle Ten Council camps are approved for Cub camping in appropriate sites. Please be patient as the council works through approving other sites in our area for Cub camping. If you have a specific site you need approved, please send that information to Michael Prachar, and we will work through the process.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023CWFallTrainingEvent"><strong>Outdoor Fall Training Event November 11th & 12th </strong></a></p>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">BALOO</p>
<p>BALOO is one of the required training's for a Pack to do overnight Pack camping events. The Pack must have one leader with this training on any Pack camp out but it is recommended that Packs have several leaders with the training to make sure all Pack camp outs can be covered. This training is designed for adults over 21 who are registered as an adult leader in a Cub Scout Pack, but other adults can attend. It focuses on using the learning environment (aka camping) to teach your Scouts and parents about camping, assisting the Pack with campout planning, and to strengthen the Pack program on campouts.</p>
<p>Introduction To Outdoor Leadership Skills (IOLS)</p>
<p>IOLS is required for all direct contact leaders (Scoutmasters and Assistant Scoutmasters) in Scouts BSA Troops to be considered a TRAINED LEADER. It is also beneficial to Committee Chairs and Troop members as it provides a better understanding of Scout BSA's outdoor program. Aside from covering some basic camping and outdoor information, this training covers an experiential learning of the Patrol method used by Scouts BSA troops. Scoutmasters and Assistant Scoutmasters will need to have completed the Scoutmaster Position Specific Training modules and be current for Youth Protection Training to receive a TRAINED patch at the end of the course. These online training's can be found at my.scouting.org.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops (ILST)</p>
<p>The purpose of the ILST (Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops) course is to teach Scouts with leadership positions about their new roles and how to most effectively reach success in that role. ILST is the first course in the series of leadership training offered to Scouts and is a replacement for Troop Leadership Training. The next course in the series is National Youth Leadership Training.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">Prerequisites</p>
<p>You will need to do pre-course work in my.scouting.org for either IOLS or BALOO or attend an in-person ALT training, need to have your position training (Scoutmaster, Assitant Scoutmaster, Cubmaster, Den Leader, or Committee Chair) and have current Youth Protection Training to earn your Coveted "Trained" patch. Go to <a href="http://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> to find Scoutmaster Specific and Youth Protection Training.</p>
</div>
<p style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold;">Additional Training Beyond position training:</p>
<p>Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well. This and many other excellent training courses are available at <a href="http://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p>
