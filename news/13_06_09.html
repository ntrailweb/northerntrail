<a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=twilight">Twilight Camp Information</a> -- Twilight Camp Walking Den Leader information packet is available on the website. Don't forget you will need <a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content/face-to-face">Face-to-Face Youth Protection Training</a>. </td></tr>


<tr><td><a href="">Still need Face to Face YPT?</a> -- There is one remaining Face to Face Youth Protection Training session that is on the Tuesday night of Twilight Camp so it is perfect for Tiger Parents since they don't come to camp until Wednesday.<br /><br />

You can register for the training <a href="http://www.ntrail.org/?q=content%2Fface-face-youth-protection-6">here</a> so they know how many to expect. The training will be held on Tuesday, June 11th at 7:30 at First United Methodist Church of Richardson, 503 North Central Expressway, in the Bartula Family Life Center building.<br /><br />

Please bring a copy of your card to camp (or bring the card itself if you don't have a copy) since I will not be at this training session to make a copy of the cards like I normally do.
