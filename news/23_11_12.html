<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Campout and Event Planning</p>
<p>From Donald Blum, Emergency Risk Management Committee, Northern Trail District
The American Academy of Pediatrics has published an article in their recent journal entitled, Improving Health and Safety at Camp. The authors discuss the benefits of camping, role of adults and the role of the camp. The article is very interesting and provides subjects which should be considered when planning a campout or event for your unit. The article is available for you to review in its entirety <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/144/1/e20191355/37095/Improving-Health-and-Safety-at-Camp?autologincheck=redirected"><strong>here</strong></a> </p>
<p>The highlights for me were concerns related to age and skill related activities and the challenge of the facility, considerations to be made related to the interests the participants have in the outing, and finally being alert to medical issues that might affect your group such as food allergies and sensitivities.
Please review the article.  Perhaps after reading there might be a pearl which will help you and your group when planning your next outing.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>Those of us who have been involved with scouting for many years know that the recharter process can be a little painful. Avoid the pain in two ways, first don't wait until the last minute. The second way to avoid headaches is to follow the <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>procedure</strong></a> and ask questions if you have any doubts. Seeming minor things like signatures will land your recharter in the "defective" pile and the problems will need to be worked.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for recharter in your unit, make sure your dues are paid and any required training is complete. An out-of-date YPT card is a non-starter!  Please do your part.  Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>Youth Protection Training Current?</strong></a></p>
<p>Your unit cannot complete Recharter if your YPT card is not current. Time flies, check your card and take the training if needed. Get training at: <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. Don't wait, get done now.</p>
<p>Unit leaders, check the status of the adults in your unit now online.</p>

<p>The weather is great and it is the best way to learn about Scouts BSA for both Webelos (and their parents). Find out what Scouts BSA is all about. Troops will host Webelos Scouts from various packs and will form patrols which will include those Webelos Scouts for the weekend. Packs will be assigned to camp with a host Troop by the event staff.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>Winter Camp Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp</strong></a> December 27- 31, 2023</strong></p>

<p>Circle Ten Council’s annual Winter Camp at Trevor Rees-Jones Scout Camp is a special jamboree-style camping event for Scouts BSA Troops, Venturing Crews, and Sea Scout Ships.  It is the largest annual event put on by Circle Ten Council and is staffed by Circle Ten’s Mikanakawa Lodge of the Order of the Arrow.</p>
<p>Units camp jamboree style with multiple Units in a single campsite.  The chance to make new friends from outside your immediate Scouting circle is one of the key rewards.  Food is prepared by each Unit in their campsites (with the exception of the optional closing night BBQ).  <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023WinterCamp"><strong>More information.</strong></a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2024Rendezvous">Rendezvous 2024</strong></a></p>
<p>March 8-10 (most activities on the 9th).  Registered Venturers, Sea Scouts, and Explorer Post members are invited.  We will be inviting people from the entire NST 8 (National Service Territory) this year and are hoping to restore the event to pre-COVID days.  Much planning to be done but we need people to save the date and consider joining a Venturing Crew if they want to participate.</p>
<p>We have solved the pistol issues, at least for now, and are looking forward to a terrific event this coming spring.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Upcoming Training</strong></p>

<p>Fall training has concluded.  On-line training is available at <a href="http://my.scouting.org"><strong>here</strong></a>.  Don't overlook hazardous weather training which is required for campouts. In person training will be scheduled in the spring, watch the calendar and newsletter for details.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Follow up on New Members:</strong> Pack Unit Leaders, don't forget to check in with every prospective parent that signed-in on the attendance rosters from your SNFS events.

<li><strong>Grow your Membership:</strong>
Growing your membership should be a year round activity. You should always be looking for opportunities to recruit more scouts into the program! Pack and troop leaders, if you'd like to hold a fall recruitment event for your unit, the council can assist you in promoting it. Email <a href="mailto:katherine.mccrary@scouting.org"><strong>katherine.mccrary@scouting.org</strong></a> to create and print fliers to be distributed in your community.</li>
