<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">Adult Recognition</a></strong></p>
<p>Recognition is a big part of the scout program. It is so important that we hold special ceremonies to mark the achievements of our scouts. There is no doubt that our scouts appreciate the recognition.</p>
<p>Being shown genuine appreciation for our achievements and hard work is a natural human emotion. Some who claim that that they don't care about recognition are probably not being totally honest.</p>
<p>Scouting is fueled by volunteers. Without their hard work and dedication, the program simply would not exist. All of us are aware of individuals in our units and at the district level who volunteer countless hours and more importantly than the hours, make a substantial difference. These individuals deserve our thanks and recognition.</p>
<p>This recognition is so important that we hold an awards banquet every year for the specific purpose of recognizing these individuals at the unit, district and council levels.  The banquet will be held on <nobr>January 18, 2018.</nobr></p> 
<p>We have the date, venue and a speaker, what we need now is to identify those individuals which should be recognized. This is where you come in. Look around your unit and think about the people who have really made a difference in your unit. Some of these individuals are active at the district and council levels. There are awards for all of these individuals. Please don't assume that someone else will make the nomination.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Y</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold;">E</span>.<span style="font-weight:bold;">S</span>. or <span style="font-weight:bold;">Your Extraordinary Service</span> award is designed to recognize individuals in units like packs, troops and crews. We have an <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/yes-your-extraordinary-service-award">on-line</a> form which makes this process easy. The deadline is December 1st.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold;">District Award of Merit</span> is presented by districts or Venturing divisions in the same manner that the Silver Beaver is a national award presented by councils. More information and nomination form may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/district-award-merit">here</a>. The deadline for this award is December 1st.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Robert E. Little Award</span> is specific to Northern Trail and recognizes a scouter who has rendered outstanding service to the scouting movement at the unit and/or district level. It is given primarily for dedicated service, personal effort, and unselfish interest contributed beyond the immediate responsibilities of the position or positions held over a period of years. <a href="http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-103_WB.pdf">More information and nomination form.</a> Deadline for submissions is December 1st.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold;">Silver Beaver</span> 
Award is the council-level distinguished service award of the Boy Scouts of America. Upon nomination by their local Scout council and with the approval of the National Court of Honor, recipients of this award are registered adult leaders who have made an impact on the lives of youth through service given to the council. Award Nominations are due November 20th. We have many scouters in Northern Trail that could be nominated and you could easily be that person who gets their nomination started. Think about the scouters you have seen at events in the last year and could you nominate one of them. If you have questions about how to get the needed information ask other scouters who might know.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the process?  We have a volunteer who can assist. Contact Dr. Harry Yankuner, <a href="mailto: HY18@sbcglobal.net">HY18@sbcglobal.net</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Please stop what you are doing and submit a nomination today!</span></p>
