<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Troop 121 Memorial Service</strong></p>

<p><i>(From the Troop 121 website:  <a href="http://www.northstarbsa.org/node/283">http://www.northstarbsa.org/node/283</a></i>)</p>

<p>As many of you probably know, tragedy struck the Troop 121 group at Northern Tier Canoe Bases early Thursday morning.</p>
<p>While camping over night at Basswood Lake a squall line of severe thunderstorms with high winds struck the area they were camping, toppling trees.</p>
<p>Scout C. Sanchez and assistant Scoutmaster Nickie Lac were killed in the storm. Two other unnamed Scouts were also injured, but according to National's press release on the incident, their injuries don't appear to be life threatening.  <a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/07/21/boy-scout-scout-leader-killed-on-mn-camping-trip-from-north-texas/">News Story</a></p>
<p>Troop 121 is planning memorial event at their troop meeting Monday night, July 25 at 7pm at the First United Methodist Church, 2201 E. Hebron Pkwy, Carrollton, TX US 75010. They have invited all Scouters from Circle 10 and the Longhorn council who want to send representatives from their units to attend.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Popcorn</strong></p>

<p>It’s time to sign up for the 2016 Popcorn World Series fundraiser. We are gearing up for our best year yet, and some exciting changes have been made to the program, including a new vendor (CAMP MASTERS), new popcorn selections and more.  Popcorn kernel training is just around the corner, with sessions being held on Aug. 2, 4, 6, 9, 11 & 13.  You will need to register for one of these “batting practices” within the next week. Before you can attend a training session, you must first register your pack/troop/team for popcorn sales. Visit the Council website to sign up, for additional details and for critical dates at <a href="http://circleten.org/popcorn">circleten.org/popcorn</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, you won’t want to miss out on an opportunity to attend the exciting and motivating Michael Beck Sales Training, to be held at AMC Valley View 16 on Thursday, August 18. Selling popcorn is easy with the right training and support, and achieving high popcorn sales goals will help fund both your unit operations and the Council’s programming. Selling popcorn also teaches Scouts the value of contributing their time and effort to making the Scouting program the best it can be. Register TODAY!

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fall Training</strong></p>

<p>Training dates have been posted to the calendar.  If you have leaders who lack training, please insure that they allocate the time to attend training.    Training is not just for front line leaders.  Parents who want their scout to get the most out of the program should attend training and learn just how the scouting program works.  Training will make your job easier and you will get much better results.</p>
