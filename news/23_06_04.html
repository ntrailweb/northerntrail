<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Be Safe in the Sun</p>
<p>Sunlight is one of the two most important factors for <strong>Ecosystems</strong>, according to experts. Exposure to sunlight helps humans synthesize vitamin D, which helps the muscular skeletal and nervous systems work properly.</p>
<p> However, it is important to know the <strong>Ultaviolet</strong> RAYS (UV) can be harmful. The first Monday of May is <strong>Melanoma Awareness Month</strong>; June is <strong>Sun Safety Awareness Month</strong>; and July marks <strong>UV Awareness Month</strong>.</p>
<p>Protect your skin when exposed to the sun especially during the summer months, whether it is clear and sunny or cloudy with no sun visible.</p>
<p>The American Cancer Society estimates almost 98,000 people will receive a new diagnosis for <strong>Melonoma</strong> in 2023.</p>
<p>Some tips for protection of your skin and eyes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wear sunscreen and remember to reapply it throughout the day. Do not forget to apply sunscreen to your ears, nose and top of your feet. The higher the SPF (sun protection factor) the better. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Broad-spectrum protection (protect against UVA and UVB rays);<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SPF 30 or higher: and<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Water Resistance</li>
<li>Cover up by wearing broad-brimmed hat, long sleeves and pants when out in the sun for extended period of time such as fishing, boating, hiking or even going to the zoo. Clothing designed for sun protection is tested to confirm its <strong>Ultraviolet Protection Factor</strong> (UPF), which will give greater control over your total level of UV exposure. Look for the garments UPF rating to evaluate its true UV protection.</li>
<li>Finding shade under trees, umbrellas or awnings provides excellent sun protection.</li>
<li>Protect your eyes by wearing glasses that are 100% UV protected. The darkness of the sunglasses without the UV protection does not offer the same protection. Look for sunglasses that have a polarized tint to protect against UV rays. When purchasing prescription glasses ask for UV protection as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a safe and enjoyable summer. Enjoy the outdoors whatever the activity but take a few minutes to protect your skin and eyes.</p>
