<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Not Deciding is Deciding</strong></p>

<p>We are all time challenged in our fast paced world. Too often we put things off and they are left undone. Intending to do something does not help if it never gets done. A great example is Adult Recognition. All of us see individuals who go above and beyond the call of duty in our scout units and we believe that they should be applauded for what they do. If we fail to take the next step and nominate these individuals for an award, our good intentions are for naught. Every year there are deserving individuals who are not recognized because no one found the time to turn an intention into an action.</p>

<p>So whether it is an adult award nomination, signing up for training, event or attending roundtable, please don't put it off, turn the intention into a decision. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Act today</span>!</p> 

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">Adult Recognition</a></strong></p>

<p>Time to nominate and recognize adult leaders in the district who have contributed to the success of the program; Y.E.S.-Your Extraordinary Service Award, District Award of Merit, The Robert E. Little Award and the Silver Beaver. Deadline for the Silver Beaver is November 20th and for the other awards the deadline is December 1st. More information and nomination forms may be found on the <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">website.</a></p>
