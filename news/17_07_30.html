<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Get Ready for Fall</strong></p>
<p>Where did the summer go!   August is upon us and it’s time to get back into swing of scouting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Roundtables</span></p>
<p>Roundtables will begin the second week of August.  If you have not attended Roundtables in the past or got out of the habit of going, this is a great opportunity to start taking advantage of this great resource.  Roundtables are about a lot of things, but the most important function is to help you create a better scouting experience for your scouts.   In the business world we often talk about benchmarking, that is comparing what we do with what others are doing.  “We’ve always done it that way,” may not be the best approach.   Roundtable exposes you to “best practices”  in scouting and gives you access to mentors and fellow parents and leaders who are facing the same challenges in scouting and the larger problem of raising self-sufficient, moral and responsible adults.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Events</span></p>
<p>Mark your calendar for third Outdoor Adventure which will be held on Saturday September 9th.   This is a community event held at a local city park and it an opportunity to showcase scouting to the community as a whole.  The event organizers are looking for units and individuals to assist with the activities.  If you can help, please contact Marjie Price at <a href="mailto:msmn1204@gmail.co">msmn1204@gmail.co</a>m.</p>

Plan to attend, Wednesday October 4th and  Wednesday October 11th.  This is an excellent course and a lot of fun.  You will be surprised  at how much you learn and how much fun you had.  Participants in Boy Scout Leader Specific training can also attend Outdoor Leader Specific training which is structured as a scout campout where you can  observe first hand from the perspective the scouts how the program operates.  Great fun and you will learn a lot.</p>
