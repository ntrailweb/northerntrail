<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">90% of Life is About Showing Up</p>
<p>Success in life begins with showing up.  Not only showing up but showing up consistently and being present.</p>
<p>Scouting is not about entertainment, it’s about character development, leadership training and personal fitness.  These concepts are elegantly embodied in the scout oath and law which every scout repeats at every meeting from memory.</p>
<p>For scouting to have the desired impact, scouts and adults need to show up for meetings, events, and training.  Once present the process of developing life skills can begin and be nurtured through repeated exposure.</p>
<p>Being present means actively participating as a member of the group.  Just going through the motions is not enough.  Scouts need to take on leadership roles in their patrols and troop.  Roles such as patrol leader, scribe, quartermaster, and chaplain are examples.  This includes active participation in patrol meetings and campout planning.</p>
<p>While individual achievement in scouting is important, working to help fellow scouts achieve their goals is equally important.  Teaching others is the best way to ensure complete knowledge of a given skill.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to show up, don’t let weeks go by without attending meetings because momentum will be lost which can’t easily be recovered.  Make showing up a habit rather than a chore.</p>

</ul>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>Those of us who have been involved with scouting for many years know that the recharter process can be a little painful. Avoid the pain in two ways, first don't wait until the last minute. The second way to avoid headaches is to follow the <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/55546/annual-recharter"><strong>procedure</strong></a> and ask questions if you have any doubts. Seeming minor things like signatures will land your recharter in the "defective" pile and the problems will need to be worked.</p>
<p>If you are not responsible for recharter in your unit, make sure your dues are paid and any required training is complete. An out-of-date YPT card is a non-starter!  Please do your part.  Waiting until the last minute is hard on everyone.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>Youth Protection Training Current?</strong></a></p>
<p>Your unit cannot complete Recharter if your YPT card is not current. Time flies, check your card and take the training if needed. Get training at: <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>. Don't wait, get done now.</p>
<p>Unit leaders, check the status of the adults in your unit now online.</p> 
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>Financial Aid</strong></a>
<p>Financial aid is available for families who need help with scouting expenses. More information available <a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/financial_aid.html"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership + Recruiting</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Follow up on New Members:</strong> Pack Unit Leaders, don't forget to check in with every prospective parent that signed-in on the attendance rosters from your SNFS events. A followup phone call, email or even a postcard can make the difference. Remember, you understand the value of the scout program, with new parents you must sell the program.</li>

<li><strong>Grow your Membership:</strong>
Growing your membership should be a year round activity. You should always be looking for opportunities to recruit more scouts into the program! Pack and troop leaders, if you'd like to hold a fall recruitment event for your unit, the council can assist you in promoting it. Email <a href="mailto:katherine.mccrary@scouting.org"><strong>katherine.mccrary@scouting.org</strong></a> to create and print fliers to be distributed in your community.</li>
