<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">2021 Friends of Scouting Campaign</strong></p>

<p>We are collectively facing the most challenging time in recent history, and COVID has profoundly impacted all aspects of our lives. While the virus has disrupted many activities, the scouting program has continued and is adapting to the challenges of meeting in groups while keeping Scouts and leaders safe through social distancing, masks and plenty of hand washing and hand sanitizer. As scouts and adults have increased safety measures to keep everyone healthy, we are asking you to help us keep the financial foundation of scouting solid by donating generously to Friends of Scouting this year. We are asking everyone to step up their financial support to ensure the continued economic stability of all aspects of the program. Even in the midst of a pandemic, we are hoping you will consider playing a part in the council&rsquo;s continued ability to maintain top notch facilities and offer outstanding programs for our scouting youth.</p>

<p>You can help us reach this year&rsquo;s Friends of Scouting goal of $150,000 for our district through a variety of avenues. The simplest way to donate TODAY is to utilize the online <a href="https://tinyurl.com/NTFOS2021">link</a> we have provided here. You can also help us attain this ambitious goal by approaching your employer/corporation to see if they offer a matching gift program and/or will pay for volunteer hours (more to come about this possibility in a future newsletter). Finally, we encourage you to reach out to Vaughn Dubose, our FOS Family Chairperson, to schedule one of our FOS speakers to make a presentation at one of your unit meetings, at your Blue and Gold dinner, or at a Court of Honor. Vaughn can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:vaughndubose@gmail.com">vaughndubose@gmail.com</a>.</p>
