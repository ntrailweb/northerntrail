<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Outdoor Adventure: CANCELLED</strong></p>
<p>We have cancelled the Outdoor Adventure scheduled for September 9 due to lack of participation.  We understand that the beginning of the school year is extremely busy, and it is difficult to add another event into the mix.  We still believe an event for the RISD community has value. We welcome your input on how we can sponsor an event that would benefit all the units in our district.</p><p>Please share your thoughts with our activities chair, Marjie Price - <a href="mailto:msmn1204@gmail.com">msmn1204@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Thank you to those units who did sign up to participate.  Your support is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Boy Scout Roundtable</strong> Tuesday September 12th, 7:00PM</p>

<p>Boy Scout Roundtable discussion in September will feature "an answer to every question you have about advancement." This open forum is designed for your unit's Advancement Chairperson, any leader in your unit who has questions about advancement and all parents of Boy Scouts.  It will be conducted by our District Committee Advancement Chairman, Bob Faulkner.</p>

<p>Your take away will be up-to-date advancement information and resources for getting answers to future questions.  </p>

<p>Advancement is one of the most important factors to having a successful Troop. Through advancement, our boys learn how to set goals, how to systematically achieve them and then publicly receive the reward of Advancement for completing their goals.</p>

<p>Advancement keeps scouts focused, if they don't advance they will drift away. Keep your Troop strong.  Ensure each boy achieves advancement.  Attend this important meeting.</p>  

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Cub Scout Roundtable</strong> Thursday September 14th, 7:00PM</p>

Come join us at roundtable on September 14th at 7 p.m.  at First United Methodist Church of Richardson 503 N. Central Expressway room 212 in the education building. Just think how fortunate you are as a Cub Scout leader to have monthly training and great resources available to you!</p>
