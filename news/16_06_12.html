<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Twilight Camp Achievements</strong></p>

<p>We had a great Twilight Camp this year, thanks to the efforts of a lot of great volunteers. The scouts and adults had a wonderful time. The achievements will be announced shortly, so watch the newsletter, website and Facebook.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Summertime Activities</strong></p>

<p>Don't let your scout program cool off during the summer. Schedule an activity over the summer for your unit. Family cookouts and pizza parties are easy to organize. It's also a great time to work in a service project. There are countless organizations who could use a little scout labor to help out!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Service project opportunity</strong></p>

<p>This was passed on to me by another scouter and I don't have any additional information. Like all scouting activities, be sure to check thoroughly before participating in any activity.

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org">Move to Council Website</a></strong></p>
<p>The current Northern Trail website will very soon permanently relocate to <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org">northerntrail.circleten.org</a>. Your help is needed to determine what content needs to be included on the new site. We have more than ten years of material on current site and it's just not easy or practical to move it all. <i><strong>The squeaky wheel gets the grease!</strong></i> Let me know what you want to see moved and we will do our best to accommodate your requests. Take a look at what is there now and let me know what you think needs to be included.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-service-hours-reporting">Unit Service Hours Reporting</a></strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s easy and helps demonstrate how our program and its members provide many selfless hours of volunteer service supporting and improving our local communities. <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-service-hours-reporting">Keep reading</a></strong></p>

<p>If you have been involved in scouts for a while and particularly if your Scout has moved on, commissioner service is a great way to keep up with scouting, continue to provide a valuable service, and make a difference. <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioner-service"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Continue reading</span></a></p>
