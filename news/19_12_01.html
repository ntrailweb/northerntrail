<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong></p>

<p>We have only a few nominations and should have many more. Please take the time to nominate someone from your unit.  On January 23 at the District Awards Banquet, we will recognize volunteers who have made the extra effort to make scouting possible in our units and the district.</p><p>Every unit should have at least one nominee for a Y.E.S. award. Being recognized for one's efforts is appreciated and volunteers are more likely to continue to contribute if they feel their efforts are making a difference.&nbsp; Then plan to bring them to the dinner and help us recognize their contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The District Awards of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award recognize district level volunteers who make a profound impact on the program delivered at the district level.</p>

<p>More information and nomination forms may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">here</a>. Questions to: Dr. Harry Yankuner <a href="mailto:HY18@sbcglobal.net">HY18@sbcglobal.net</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-recharter-time">Re-charter Time</a></strong></p>

<p>Today is December 1st. As as of Wednesday, November 27, only 15 units of the 53 units in our district that will be re-chartering I have begun the process according to counsel records. Only one of those units has progressed to the point of submitting their recharter. (congratulations Troop 707!).</p>
<p>This means that there are 38 units that have not begun the recharter process. Remember that all unit charters expire on December 31st. If your unit is one of those that has not begun the recharter process it needs to do so immediately. Remember, that as we get closer to the December 31 deadline the Internet will be crowded with units around the country trying to complete their recharter. Thus it is crucial to get this done early. In addition, there are signatures that your unit will need to obtain and those may be difficult to get after schools break for the holidays.</p>
<p>If youâ€™ve got any questions please contact your unit commissioner or me.<br />
