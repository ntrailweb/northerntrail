<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong> Deadlines approaching!</p>
<p><i><b>Silver Beaver Deadline:</i> November 18, 2019</b></p>
<p>We have only a few nominations for Silver Beaver. There are many outstanding candidates in the district and they should be recognized. Even if the nominee is not recognized this year, they can be re-submitted in future years. The council deadline is November 22 and Dr. Yankuner needs your inputs immediately.</p>

<p>Every unit should have nominees for a Y.E.S. award. Being recognized for one's efforts is appreciated and volunteers are more likely to continue to contribute if they feel their efforts are making a difference.</p>

<p>The District Awards of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award recognize district level volunteers who make a profound impact on the program delivered at the district level.</p>

<p>Please take a minute and review the awards and consider someone you know who should be recognized. More information and nomination forms may be found <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">here</a>. Questions to: Dr. Harry Yankuner <a href="mailto:HY18@sbcglobal.net">HY18@sbcglobal.net</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-recharter-time">Re-charter Time</a></strong></p>

<p>One of the most pressing issues every year is getting every unit re-chartered. Failure to get this done in a timely basis makes it hard on everyone. If your unit charter drops, then you have to start from scratch and this is to be avoided. Waiting until the last minute means that everyone must scramble to get the various tasks done. Having the proper training and the needed forms can take time and the cooperation of the adult members of your unit. If you are the unit chair, it's past time to start pushing your leaders and parents to get the tasks completed. If you are a parent, don't make life more difficult for your unit leadership. Get it done today! <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-recharter-time">More information and forms.</a></p>
