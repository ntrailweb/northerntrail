<p>Day of Training, this Saturday November 3rd</p>

<p>We have training for every scout program including Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturing.</p>
<p>This training is for everyone, parent and leaders alike. there is no obligation to do anything more. Knowledge of the program, how it's organized, the aims and methods will make your job as a scout parent or leader easier.  Parents, your understanding of the program will help you encourage your scout along the trail and make you an asset to the leaders who give of their time.  No one person can do it all, running a unit is a team effort.  Invest under two hours on Saturday and it will pay dividends in the future.</p>
