<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">School Night For Scouting</strong> </p>
<p>School nights for scouting are coming and it is vital that your unit participates. It is particularly important to make these new scouts and their parents feel welcome in your unit. With new scouts come new parents and new parents have enthusiasm, skills, and energy to help your unit thrive.</p>
<p>Please contact Katherine McCrary	<a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a> if you can help with school night for scouting or have questions.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Popcorn Fund Raising</strong></p>
<p>Admit it, most of us are a bit annoyed with the constant appeals to raise money for various causes. The truth is, whether we like it or not, it takes money to operate a program like scouting. Funding is needed to pay for facilities, programs and the professionals needed to operate them. Without adequate funding, scouting cannot deliver a quality program. Please consider the value of scouting and step up to help.</p>
<p>The annual Popcorn sale is now in progress and if your unit has not signed up to participate, it's not too late. The popcorn sale is a vital part of the overall income to the council, and it supports not only the council, but your unit and scouts benefit as well.</p>
<p>Contact our District Popcorn Kernel, Amy Weems by phone or email for help: 817-891-0736, <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:amy.weems82@gmail.com">amy.weems82@gmail.com</a>. More information <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/30562/popcorn">here.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/arapahochapter">Arapaho Chapter News</a></strong></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p> 
<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>
<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p>
