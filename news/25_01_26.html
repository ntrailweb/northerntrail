<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">But, We’ve Always Done it That Way!</p>
<p>Change for the sake of change is rarely a good thing. We must adapt, and scouting has adapted with changing times and new realities. An example is expanding the program to include girls in all programs. Changing the name of the organization to better reflect the organization as a family-centered program better reflects the character of the movement.</p>
<p>There are aspects of scouting which are timeless, and these are embodied in the scout oath, law, methods and aims. The outdoor program focused on camping hiking and high adventure is still key to the success of scouting. This is accomplished by getting youth out of their everyday routines and providing them the opportunity for fun, new experiences, leadership and learning by experiencing the consequences of their decisions.</p>
<p>The safety of our scouts is of paramount importance while allowing scouts to fully experience the challenges. The information and the processes to keep our scouts safe, continues to evolve and the <a href="https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/toc/"><strong>resources</strong></a> are available to every leader to ensure the safest possible environment.</p>
<p>Scouting works because it is a well thought out program which has stood the test of time. Our job as leaders is to deliver this program to the youth in our care and not reinvent the program to match our personal vision. There are plenty of opportunities for innovations like unique camping destinations and activities without attempting to change things like advancement processes and procedures.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Day Of Service</p>
<p>Scouting America’s National Day of Service is Saturday, February 8. In Northern Trail we have three service project beneficiaries, the City of Richardson’s Parks Department, Network of Community Ministries, and First United Methodist Church.</p>
<p>We will be providing service to the Richardson Parks Department at Breckenridge Park, Spring Creek Nature Area and Richardson’s Network of Community Ministries.</p>
<p>Projects will involve landscape, cleanup and improvements. Sign up online <a href="here"><strong>https://bit.ly/3Wcv8iL</strong></a> here and indicate where your unit can help.</p>
<p>Be sure and also <a href="https://247scouting.com/forms/571-2025DayofService"><strong>sign-up</strong></a> on the Circle Ten BlackPug site so council and national can measure the amount of participation.</p>
<p>Participants should bring work gloves and trash pickers or grabbers if they have them.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, contact Hank Voegtle, at (214) 769-5040 or email me at <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com"><strong>hjv3@outlook.com</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Scout Shabbat</strong></p>

<p>there will be a Havdalah service for Scout Shabbat February 8th 2025 at Anshai Torah in Plano at 7:15pm. All Jewish scouts are invited to attend. Please wear your uniform. RSVP <a href="https://app.greenrope.com/events/ScoutShabbat2025"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

 Classroom Sessions, February 5 and 12, 2025<br />
 Practical February 21-23</strong></p>	
	
<p>BAT is an interactive course designed for those individuals and Units who are preparing for a high-adventure trek and for those interested in organizing first time backcountry activities for their Unit.</p>

<p>Two classroom sessions are followed by a weekend backpacking campout adventure. The course features information and instruction detailing trek preparation, crew dynamics, and techniques of backpacking - hiking, camping, and preparing meals on the trail. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2025BAT"><strong>More information and registration</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Hazardous Weather Training Now Required</strong></p>

<p>BSA Nationals updated reporting on Hazardous Weather Training requirements last week, resulting in an immediate and dramatic decline in the number of fully-trained direct contact leaders we have in this district.</p>
<p>If you have not taken hazardous weather in the past year, please find a few minutes to confirm the expiration dates and renew your training. The online course is only 28 minutes. The training is available by logging onto <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> and then use this link:<a href="https://training.scouting.org/courses/SCO_800"><strong>https://training.scouting.org/courses/SCO_800</strong></a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Youth Protection Training (YPT)</strong></p>
<p>Avoid the rush, check your card and get it done. Training is valid for two years and you must retake the online course. If you are out of date, it is full stop. Go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> for this and other training opportunities.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"> <a href="https://my.scouting.org/" style="font-weight:bold;"><strong>Range Activities Safety Training</strong></a> </strong></p>
<p>The Range Activities SAFEty training is now available online. Every unit who participates in Range Activities must have trained leaders at the range with their units. So this is not just directed at the Unit Leader but at whomever is accompanying their unit for a range day. If you are a direct contact leader, take the course. It requires about 30 minutes of your time. Once you login to <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> you can then follow this link directly to the course at <a href="https://training.scouting.org/courses/SCO_822"><strong>https://training.scouting.org/courses/SCO_822</strong></a></p>
