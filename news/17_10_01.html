<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Adult Recognition</strong></p>

<p>This is the time of the year we think about who in Northern Trail should be recognized for their scouting efforts; this can be at the unit and/or district and council level.</p>

<p>At the unit level we have the Y.E.S.-Your Extraordinary Service Award, each unit can nominate 2 adults and 1 more for every additional 50 youth in the unit. Adults activity at district level- OA and District Committee can be nominated as well. The unit determines who receives the award.</p>

<p>The District Award of Merit is a council award presented by the district at their annual dinner. This person could have chaired one event or/and been involved in many scouting activities. A district committee selects the awardees from the nominations.</p>

<p>The Robert E. Little Award is a district award for long service to scouting. The district selects one person each year.</p>

Little awards. The deadline for each of these is <span style="font-weight:bold;">Dec 1, 2017</span></p>
