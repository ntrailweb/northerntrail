		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Incident Reporting</strong></p>

		<p>Years ago at a camp-out we managed to lose two scouts, don't worry, they were quickly found and in good health. As everyone should do, we counted noses periodically and realized that we had two scouts missing. It was determined that it had been about an hour since anyone had seen them. Working with the boys and adults, we organized a quick search of the immediate area and did not locate them. At this point we notified the camp ranger and the local authorities and began the process of searching for these two scouts. Another hour or so passed and it was starting to get dark. I was just about to notify the parents of the two scouts when they were located. Long story short they wandered off and made the serious mistake of crossing fence lines and were well off of the scout property when they realized that they were lost. The two scouts found a phone and were able to call for help and were returned safely to camp. After the incident, I wrote a report and detailed what had happened, what we had done and what we might have done differently. The report was submitted to both the local council and the camp host council.</p>

		<p>This was an example of an incident, that needed reporting. What did we learn, most importantly we re-enforced the basic buddy system rule. These two scouts stayed together which was the right thing to do. We were reminded of the fact that scouts need to understand that fences are there for a reason and scouts must stay within the camp boundaries. We missed these two scouts fairly quickly, however they did not tell an adult that they were off an an adventure, it truth they probably did not start out going very far, but things got a bit out of hand.</p>

		<p>Incidents will happen and as leaders we need to be prepared to act properly and report promptly. <a href="https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2022/11/16/incident-reporting-in-the-bsa-how-it-works-and-why-it-matters/">Here</a> is a recent article in scouting magazine which discusses incident reporting in some detail.</p>

		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>

		<p>We hope your re-charter is done, but if not, time is running out. It won't happen immediately, but if your charter drops, it's much more involved than getting it done before the deadline. There is a little grace period, but in the meantime your scouts can't advance and you cannot operate your unit.</p>

		<p>Save the hassle and get it done. Help is available.</p>

		<p>Contact the <a href="mailto:steve_bloberger@icloud.com">district commissioner</a> for assistance.</p>
