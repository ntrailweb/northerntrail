<p style="font-size:1.7em; font-weight:bold;">A New Chapter In District Communications</p>
<p style="clear:left;">After a rewarding journey of more than two decades, I have made the decision to step down.  It is going to be difficult to let go, but it is past time. I had the opportunity to introduce innovative technology to our district communications which has extended the reach far beyond what was possible before.</p>
<p>Imagine a time before smartphones and social media. When I began the Internet was still new. Email was our best option, backed up with a basic website.</p>
<p>Today we have Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snap Chat, Discord, Groups.io and GroupMe to name just a few. We still have email and websites.</p>
<p>We are seeking a dedicated, innovative individual who will find new ways to reach the members of the district with vital information to make their units stronger and ensure the safety and success of our youth.</p>
<p>This is a rewarding position with the opportunity to implement new ideas.  Additionally, unlike many positions, it can be done remotely. I composed many newsletters in remote locations using my phone to connect to the internet. Contact Lester Cox <a href="mailto:lester.cox@icloud.com"><strong>lester.cox@icloud.com</strong></a> if you know of a suitable candidate or would like to consider this position yourself.</p>
<p>The primary goal of district communications is to inform existing and new members about required training, opportunities for additional training, district events and resources to help with unit operations.</p>
<p>I am thankful to have had the opportunity to fill this position and have enjoyed working with outstanding scouters, both volunteer and professional.
<p>As someone who is active in our district, I value your opinion about how to best achieve the communications goals using the tools available today.  Please reach out to me with your suggestions so I can pass them on to my successor.   You can reach me at: <a href="mailto:news@ntrail.org"><strong>news@ntrail.org</strong></a></p>
<p>Thanks for your help.<br />
John Slaughter<br />
Communications Chair</p>
