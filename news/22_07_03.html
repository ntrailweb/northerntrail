<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Dates in Calendar are Closer Than They Appear</strong></p>
<p>Wow, it's already July. It won't be long before school starts. First day of school for RISD is August 16th. Now is the time to get ready for your fall programs, campouts and adult leader training. It will also be time to get ready for re-charter.</p>
<p>From experience I can tell you that re-charter is relatively painless if you start early. Everyone in a unit has a role. If you are responsible for re-charter, it's imperative that you get the word out to your unit early and often that it's time to complete the required training and get any required paperwork turned in. Everyone else needs to take this task seriously and get it done well before the deadline. Waiting until the last minute is a recipe for frustration. Start now and get the lion's share done early and then it's not too difficult to wrap it up at the end.</p>
<p>Remember every registered adult, must have a current Youth Protection Card to complete the re-charter process. YPT is good for two years. It just takes some time in front of a computer to complete the course. So check your records and remind folks who need training to get it done now.</p>
<p>Speaking of training. Every front line leader needs to be trained for the position they hold. Both on-line and and preferably in-person training is available. Watch for details for in-person training in the fall.</p> 

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Popcorn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Popcorn pays for: campouts, annual dues & recharter, uniforms, patches, unit supplies & equipment, and a whole lot of FUN!!!</li>
<li>Commit to the sale here. Even if you are not sure who your unit kernel is, have 1 leader sign up. It is imperative that you get in the system early so your unit can begin preparing and receiving information from Trail’s End.</li>
<li>We have a LOCAL Richardson Popcorn kickoff so that it’s more accessible to the leaders – it’s in the neighborhood! Here’s the link to signup: <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022PopcornKickoffRichardson">https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022PopcornKickoffRichardson</a></li>

<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
