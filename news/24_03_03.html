<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Signup for Summer Camp</strong></p><p>
<p>Outdoor activities, especially summer camp are a key element of the Scouting program. Why is this so important? To achieve the aims of the scouting movement we need to hold the attention of the young people who are participating. Lose that hold and they will find other avenues to pursue. Once gone from the program we can no longer provide the unique opportunity scouting provides to achieve the AIMS: Character, Citizenship, Personal Fitness and Leadership.</p>
<p>Summer camp is fun, unique, challenging and rewarding. In addition to the fun, camp provides opportunities for skills development, leadership, teamwork, and self-reliance.</p>
<p>Our scouts sometimes have short memories, and we might need to remind them of the fun they had last year or perhaps the fun you had at a summer camp.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;"><strong>Friends of Scouting</strong></p>
<p>Remember the <a href="https://ntrail.org/news/24_02_11.htm"><strong>story</strong></a> a few weeks ago about <i><strong>Whose Job is it anyway?</strong></i> Supporting scouting is everyone's job and while all of us have limited assets, we can all pitch in and help. Even small amounts add up. Your support, large or small is essential for maintaining facilities, programs and staff needed to make scouting possible in Circle Ten.</p>

<p>Unit leaders, you can help by scheduling an FOS presentation. Contact Patti Otte <a href="mailto:patti@otte.us"><strong>patti@otte.us</strong></a> to arrange a presentation.</p>

<p>If you wish, you may give online <a href="https://donations.scouting.org/#/council/571/appeal/15"><strong>here</strong></a>, be sure and select Northern Trail District in the district field.</p>
