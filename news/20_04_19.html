<p>With everyone stuck at home, this is a great time to get come required training out of the way. Many of us need to take as a minimum Youth Protection Training. This certification is valid for two years. To take the course visit <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org</a>. While you are there, take advantage of the wealth of training resources.

<p style="font-size:18px"><a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html"><strong>Commissioners</a></strong></p>
<p>Commissioners and COVID-19. With restrictions still in place, its hard for unit commissioners to know what issues your unit might be encountering. Last week, we had an online roundtable that was well attended, but not every unit was represented. We would like to know your unit’s successes and failures during this unusual time. If your Unit Commissioner has not reached out to you, reach out to them or reach out to me directly at <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com">hjv3@outlook.com</a> or 214-769-5040. <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Here.</a> is a chart of commissioner assignments.</p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend this course at Philmont this summer!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America's ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant's vision.<br />
