<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Commissioner Service</strong></p>
<p>It can be a bit daunting trying to operate a scouting unit. There are a lot of moving parts and they all must function for a unit to be healthy and active.</p><p>Like any job, having a resource you can tap for guidance and encouragement can be very helpful. Every unit is assigned a unit commissioner just for this reason. A unit commissioner is someone who has deep scouting knowledge and has trod the scouting trail for a long time. This person has faced most if not all the challenges you are facing or will face in scouting.</p>
<p>A unit commissioner can help make you aware of resources and strategies for success which might not be obvious. Scouting is not the same as other organizations, your commissioner can help you navigate through the process. Don't hesitate to reach out to your unit commissioner by email or phone and ask for advice or just bounce ideas off of them.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble reaching your unit commissioner, contact our district commissioner Steve Bloberger at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:steve_bloberger@icloud.com">steve_bloberger@icloud.com</a>.</p> 
</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Northern Trail Emergency Risk Management</strong></p>
<p>With the summer over and fall activities starting there should be some housekeeping activities for each unit to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check your fire extinguishers - fire extinguishers have a life of 10 years even if the needle still points to green if the extinguisher is ten years or older, replace;</li>
<li>Check first aid kits for current supplies and expiration dates; replace expired items;</li>
<li>Be familiar with your meeting place; know where the exits are and where the AED devices are located;</li>
<li>Covid-19 is still a concern, please encourage good hygiene, at meetings and camping;</li>
<li>Each adult should update their Youth Protection Training (YPT) and recommend taking Hazardous Weather and Drive Safely ( all are found at my.scouting.org)</li>
<li>Know who is at your meetings.</li>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Membership</strong> </p>
<p>Membership is a year-round activity. Don't jeopardize the future of your unit by failing to attract new members. Those who came before you made your unit possible. Consider the future scouts who will benefit from their experience in scouting.</p>
<p>Please contact Katherine McCrary	<a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a> if you can help with recruiting.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p> 
<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>
<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p>
