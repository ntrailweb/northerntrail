<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fear</strong></p>
<p>Too often in scouting the only thing which keeps many adults from helping out is fear. Fear of being overwhelmed with responsibility, fear of the needed time commitment and fear of failure.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can address all of these issues. The first key to avoiding being overwhelmed is to recognize that you are not alone. There are others in your unit who can help and you simply have to reach out on an individual basis and ask for help. It sounds so simple, but most of us hesitate to seek help. Don’t use a blanket appeal, reach out on an individual basis and ask for help with specific tasks. In addition to others in your unit, a unit commissioner is available to mentor you along the way and provide valuable insight into dealing with the problems you will encounter. He or she has already encountered and solved just about every problem you may face.</p>
<p>All of us are pressed for time, but you will find that scout leaders are all busy people. They plan rather than react to the challenges. Use your unit committee to effectively plan your activities and they will go much more smoothly with dramatically less effort.</p>
<p>Fear of failure, I can tell you that in the end, it always works out. With effective planning and a "plan B," your events and activities will be successful. They might not play out exactly as planned, but the scouts will have fun and they will learn. In addition to a good plan, don’t overlook training. Scout Leader training is first rate and you will learn how the program works and can avoid most of the pitfalls.</p>
<p>Don’t let fear get in the way of your making a difference!</p>
