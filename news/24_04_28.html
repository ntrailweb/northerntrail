<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Neither Scouts nor their families may have input on who is on a board of review. It is the Unit Committee that is solely responsible for that. A significant part of a board if review is to assess how well the program is being delivered. The unit committee is in the best position to determine which adults are best fit for that part of the role. {ref: <a href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/"><strong>https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/</strong></a>}</p>
