<ul>
<li>Going on-line today and making a personal contribution (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021">https://tinyurl.com/c10fos2021</a> please enter "Northern Trail" in the district name field!)</li>

<li>Volunteering to help with our fundraising efforts through networking including social media</li>

<li>Inviting one of our FOS speakers to your next Scouting event such as a Blue & Gold or Court of Honor</li>
</ul>
<p>***If your pack, troop, crew or ship is only holding virtual events, we would love a chance to speak during your next online meeting.***
