<p>Northern Trail now has a new communications chair, Tammy Pitt. Please support her in getting the word out about activities in the district and council. In our very busy world with a flood of information, this is a challenging task.</p>

<p>The key part of this job is providing timely and accurate information about activities, training opportunities and critical information of importance to all scouters. Tammy canâ€™t read minds and donâ€™t assume that everyone understands. New scout leaders and parents are not immediately in the know about the program.</p>

<p>When sending information to Tammy, make her job easier by putting the information into final form. This saves time and ensures that the message matches your intent.</p>

<p>Last minute submissions are hard on everyone and often lead to confusion or mistakes. Please provide the information in a timely fashion. Last minute scrambles are hard on everyone.</p>

<p>I had this role far too long and I am confident that with your support, Tammy will make communication in our district more effective and relevant.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has helped me along the way. I will admit that I will miss the job, but itâ€™s time. I expect to find other ways to serve scouting and the community.</p>

<p>Yours in Scouting,</p>
<p>John Slaughter</p>

<p><strong>There are no more Wilderness First Aid classes on the calendar for this year.</strong></p>		


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Youth Protection Training (YPT)</strong></p>
<p>Avoid the rush, check your card and get it done. The current YPT training is valid for two years then you will have to take the new training mentioned below. If you are out of date, it is full stop. Go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> for this and other training opportunities. Don't forget Hazardous Weather Training and Range Activities Safety Training.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="font-size:1.2rem;">Important Update: YPT Replacement</span></strong></h1>

    <p>Please note that <strong>YPT</strong> is being replaced with a new course called <strong>"S.A.F.E.guarding Youth."</strong> The new course contains a lot of updated information and reinforces a culture of active supervision, situational awareness, and safety.</p>

    <p>Your YPT is still valid for 2 years from the date completed, but once your current YPT expires, you will need to move to this new training.</p>

    <p><strong>S.A.F.E.guarding Youth</strong> training is 90 minutes long the first time you complete it. After completing the training one time, you will only need to complete annual 15-minute refreshers moving forward.</p>
