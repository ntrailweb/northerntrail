<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">New Year</strong></p>
<p>This is the time when many of use make resolutions for the new year. Resolutions are really about thinking about what we want to accomplish and then putting a plan into action to meet these goals. For scouting the goals might be to hold more unit campouts or other activities. In my experience these events usually turn out well and scouts and scouters are glad they participated. Even if conditions aren't perfect. On one very memorable weekend campout our troop woke up to snow covered tents. An unusual experience for scouts and adults. So make a resolution to have scouting adventures in 2022.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Looking for Information</strong></p>
<p>One of the challenges with the newsletter is keeping it to a managable size. We repeat ourselves a lot, but things roll off the newsletter. If you can't find what you are looking for in the current newsletter, you can look back in time <a href="https://ntrail.org/news/list.php">here.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Recharter all done? congratulations! Unfortunately we have a few units with delinquent charters. Without a charter you don't have a scout unit. Scouts can't advance, you can't hold meetings or participate in scouting events.</p>
<p>We have entered a period where an expired charter can still be renewed, but soon that will pass and then instead of a re-charter, you will have to start over and get a new charter. This is much more involved, so please don't wait any longer</p>

<p>Help is available, all you have to do is ask. Contact your unit commissioner or Steve Bloberger who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:steve_bloberger@icloud.com">steve_bloberger@icloud.com</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Camp Cards</strong></p>
<p>Camp Cards are a great way for scouts to earn money towards camp and other scouting activities. Camp Cards are easy to sell and are a great value. This year both Tom Thumb and Albertsons will be on the card.</p>
<p><a href="https://ntrail.org/documents/2022_Circle_Ten_Council_Camp_Card_Unit_Commitment_Form_Fillable_v.1.pdf">Here</a> is a fillable PDF commitment form. It can be filled out and emailed. Unit leaders, please submit the completed commitment form to our District Executive, Katherine McCrary at <a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a></p>
