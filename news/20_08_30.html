<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"> Correction: COVID Officers</strong></p>
<p>Each scouting activity at the <strong>district</strong> and <strong>council</strong> level only, (not unit level) will now require COVID Officers.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">EXPIRED Youth Protection Cards</strong></p>
<p>We still have many volunteers and leaders with recently expired YPT cards. YPT is designed to protect not only our scouts, but adult volunteers. It's vital that everyone understand the critical concepts and procedures which keep everyone safe. Just because someone might not be interacting in person, does not change the <span style="font-weight:bold;">requirement</span> that all adults have a <span style="font-weight:bold;">valid current YPT card</span>. Please take the time now to get current. Go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org/">my.scouting.org/</a> to take the training. Only takes about an hour.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable</strong></p>

<p>Northern Trail’s next virtual online Roundtable will be on Thursday, September 9 at 7:30 P.M. The subject will be STEM in Scouting, with breakouts for Cub Scouts, ScoutsBSA, and Venturing. Make plans to join us and invite two adults, leaders or parents, from your unit to join in. The link for the Roundtable will be sent during the week of September 5.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Recharter</strong></p>
<p>Next week it is expected that the recharter login codes will be mailed to units. Don’t lose the letter. Beginning around October 1st units will be able to log in and begin Rechartering. The sooner your unit starts, the sooner it will be finished. Circle Ten would like to see recharter completed by December 4th. That means everything will be set to go for 2021 with no break. Don't panic, if you need help, contact your <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Unit Commissioner</a> or Hank Voegtle <a href="mailto:HJV3@outlook.com">HJV3@outlook.com</a> </p>

<strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Recruiting New Scouts</strong></p>
<p>The start of the school year is the time to recruit new members. COVID makes even short-term planning challenging, but Circle Ten and the Northern Trail membership committee are working to make it successful. Our emphasis is on recruiting new Cub Scouts and there are plenty of materials available at <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources">https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/55347/2020-recruitment-resources</a>. There is an order form link on that page where you can order Cub Scout Business Cards, Scouts BSA Business Cards, Door Hangers (Cub Specific), Sticky Notes (Cub Specific), Yard Sign for families (Cub only), Yard Sign for the community (Generic Join Scouting), and customized videos which will include things such as your unit, a contact with phone and/or email, a date for a meeting, etc. Every Scouting family should have a yard sign, either Cub Specific or generic. Yard signs will demonstrate that Scouting is thriving in Northern Trail. Please contact Membership Chair Bram Franklin to coordinate, ask questions or address concerns at (214)-609-9089 or <a href="mailto:bramfranklin@gmail.com">bramfranklin@gmail.com</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">Popcorn</a></strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 has put significant financial strain on the council. Popcorn sales help units raise money for their programs and scout accounts. The popcorn program has adapted to the new normal and there are innovative ways to sell. Check out the details and get <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">signed</a> up today.</p>
<p> You can go to a warehouse club and buy a big box of microwave popcorn with each bag costing less than 30 cents. If you go to a movie theater the price of a bucket of popcorn might approach $10.00. Our popcorn sales support both the unit selling the popcorn and Circle Ten Council. Every unit should sell popcorn this year! </p>
<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">Commissioners</a></strong></p>

<p>Northern Trail has an active commissioner staff who are ready and eager to assist your unit with deep scouting knowledge. Get to know your Commissioner. Your Commissioner can help you and your unit resolve problems and pass along some great ideas to make your program even better. Our District Commissioner is Hank Voegtle who can be reached at: <a href="mailto:hjv3@outlook.com">hjv3@outlook.com</a> or 214-769-5040. To reach your commissioner unit’s Commissioner directly, refer to this <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/commissioners.html">list</a> of commissioners and their assigned units.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">BSA Bankruptcy and Sexual Abuse</strong></p><p>We know Scouting is a safe place for our youth. But in the upcoming weeks there will be more and more ads from attorneys soliciting victims of sexual abuse to make claims for damages. There are two reasons for this, first the Bankruptcy court has set a deadline for these claims to be filed, and second because states have lifted their statutes of limitations for this type of claim. The targets are men who were scouts in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. If asked about the bankruptcy let people know it is the National Council and does directly not affect Circle Ten and let them know about the changes that have been made in youth protection. Scouting is the best program for positive character development.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Wood Badge Courses</strong></span></p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
