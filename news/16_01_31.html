<p>Consider the fact that the public is willing to donate food. All we have to do is ask and pick it up. If we don&#39;t ask, the food won&#39;t get collected. Demonstrate the values of the scout program. Areas are available! Select an available area and send your selection to scouting for food chair Hunter Miller at <a href="mailto:hunter@niemanprinting.com">hunter@niemanprinting.com</a>. Hunter will explain how to obtain the needed bags.</p>
