If you have ever been to a Camporee, then you know that it’s a lot of fun with scout skills competition, activities and an awesome campfire program.</p>
<p>Camporees are always high energy and fun regardless of the weather.  We will however have great weather this year!  Here are some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/24440635@N03/sets/72157681877308615">pictures</a> from a past camporee.</p>
<p>Camporee will be held at Camp Constantin/Jack D. Furst Aquatic Base which is located on Possum Kingdom Lake in Palo Pinto County, near Graford, Texas. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CvcDi298guj">Map</a>. This is a great facility with tremendous views of the lake and spectacular local geology.</p>
<p>The theme this year will be Civil War East vs. West, expect some great and fun competitions based on the theme.</p>
