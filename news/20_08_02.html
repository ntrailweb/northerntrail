<h2>Sunday August 2, 2020</h2>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">COVID-19</strong></p>

<p>Part of Scouting is teaching problem solving to our scouts. Life deals unexpected and expected challenges and all of us must meet the challenges head on. A big part of teaching is by example. We can set the example by working hard to solve the unique problems we are facing due to the pandemic. Simply not taking advantage of the opportunity to pass on knowledge is not an acceptable solution. We must be proactive in finding ways to deliver the promise of scouting while protecting all participants. Every activity we are involved in from riding in our cars to using ordinary items involves risks. The key is to minimize the risks. With the start of a new school year, we will be faced with new challenges, some as simple as where to meet and some more complicated. These can be solved and solved safely. It won't be easy, but it can be done. We owe it to this generation of scouts, prior generations have met serious challenges including pandemics, world wars and depressions.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>The new school year is upon us and many lack both required and supplemental training. A trained leader is more effective and can focus more energy working directly with scout rather than getting bogged down trying to invent a program. Don&#39;t put it off any longer, put together a training plan today and get started.</p>

<p><a href="https://my.scouting.org/Documents/PositionTrainedCourses.pdf">Here</a> is a chart which explains the training requirements for each scouting position.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">Popcorn</a></strong></p>
<p>It is a fact that popcorn sales are a key component in meeting the financial obligations for the council. Additionally, popcorn sales help units raise money for their programs and scout accounts. The popcorn program has adapted to the new normal and there are innovative ways to sell. Check out the details and get <a href="https://circleten.ihubapp.org/posts/30562/popcorn">signed</a> up today.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Roundtable, Cub Scouts / ScoutsBSA</strong></p>

<p>Get signed up today to attend a Wood Badge Course!<br />
Wood Badge is Boy Scouts of America&#39;s ultimate leadership training for adults; designed for leaders of all BSA programs to help show those leaders how to ensure their youth get the most out of the Scouting program. Wood Badge consists of two parts. The first is a five-day practical program, usually offered in two 3-day camping experiences. The second part, completed over the following 18 months, requires participants to apply the skills they have learned in their local Scouting program by completing five goals (tickets) leading towards the participant&#39;s vision.<br />
