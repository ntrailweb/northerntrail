<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">No Roundtable this Month</strong> </p>
<p>Roundtables are for all scouters, parents and leaders. The next Roundtable will be held in March, watch for details in future newsletters.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Important: Eagle Boards of Review - Verified Applications</strong> </p>
<p>National BSA policy is that an Eagle Board of Review may not be held until the Council has verified the Eagle application. This policy protects the Scout against issues that occur if the BOR is held and then problems are found with the application.</p>
<p>In Circle Ten, the process is to submit a copy of the Eagle application to either Service Center. Most units email a scan of the application to <a href="mailto:571.eagle@scouting.org">571.eagle@scouting.org</a>, but you can hand-carry them if you want. Until Jan 10, you received back a copy of the application stamped "Verified". But now, until the new BSA system, MyBSA can generate that printed version, you will only receive an email or other certification that the application has been verified. You must show this to the District rep at or before the Eagle BOR. Without it, the BOR cannot be held. Your Eagle Designee will be happy to help you with this process. 
The list of Eagle Designees may be found <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/eagle-designees.html">here.</a></p>
