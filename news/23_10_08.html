		</ul>
<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Activities, Cub Scouts</p>
<p>Unlike Scouts BSA, the Cub Scout program is much more adult driven. Young scouts are curious about everything and like having fun. Yes, their attention spans can be short, but it’s possible to have great activities. With some careful planning, creativity, and resourcefulness you can implement some great events.</p>
<img align="right" style="float:right; margin-left:5px;" src="https://ntrail.org/images/pinewood.jpg">
<p>Keep in mind that scouting is all about the outdoors, and activities which get scouts out of the house and away from video games and TV are automatically a plus. Make it a point to include outdoor activities as part of your program. Make sure at least one of your adult leaders is <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023CWFallTrainingEvent"><strong>BALOO trained.</strong></a></p>
<p>Don’t forget pinewood derby which is a great way for scouts have quality time with a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Pack meetings can include games, crafts, skits, songs and even service projects.</p>
<p>Resources for help abound, your unit commissioner, round tables, the Internet and more experienced scouters are more than willing to make suggestions. Enlist the help of parents in your unit with activities. Make one-on-one requests, this works much better than a general call for help.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/"><strong>The Guide to Safe Scouting</strong></a> is your resource for safe, age appropriate activities.</p>
<p>Remember scouting is fun with a purpose. The fun is the hook, and the purpose is embodied in the scout oath and law.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Membership + Recruiting</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>School Night for Scouting:</strong> Fall recruiting is still in process. Northern Trail has done well so far, but we are not done yet. If you can help or need information, please contact Katherine McCrary at 	<a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org"><strong>Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</strong></a>.</li>

<li><strong>Follow up on New Members:</strong> Pack Unit Leaders, don't forget to check in with every prospective parent that signed-in on the attendance rosters from your SNFS events. A followup phone call, email or even a postcard can make the difference. Remember, you understand the value of the scout program, with new parents you must sell the program.</li>

<li><strong>Grow your Membership:</strong>
You may not be participating in SNFS, but that doesn't mean you can't grow your unit's membership. You should always be looking for opportunities to recruit more scouts into the program! Pack and troop leaders, if you'd like to hold a fall recruitment event for your unit, the council can assist you in promoting it. Email <a href="mailto:katherine.mccrary@scouting.org"><strong>katherine.mccrary@scouting.org</strong></a> to create and print fliers to be distributed in your community.</li>
</ul>


<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">It is Time to Recognize Adult Scouters</p>
<p>It is this time of year when we recognize our fellow scouters for the exemplary volunteer work that they do at the unit, district, and council levels. We remain thankful to them for their tireless service.</p>
<p>We have several awards to recognize these individuals beginning at the unit level with the Your Extraordinary Service Award or the Y.E.S. Award. At the district level we have two awards: the District Award of Merit and the Robert E. Little Award. Applications for these awards must be submitted no later than Friday, December 1st. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>At the Council level we have the Silver Beaver Award. Applications for the Silver Beaver Award must be received no later than <strong>Monday, November 20th</strong>. No applications will be accepted after this date.</p>
<p>Self-nominations will not be accepted.</p>
<p>More information, including the submission details of these awards, is available <a href="https://www.ntrail.org/adult-recognition-0.html#overlay-context="><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<p>For any questions, please contact the Awards and Recognition Chair, Muhammad Ikram at <strong>mzi@gatech.edu</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Recharter Time</p>
<p>The annual recharter process is a critical activity which must be completed for your unit to continue to operate. A charter is an agreement between your chartering organization, the Circle Ten Council and the National BSA organization. Every member of your unit both scout and adult must be properly accounted for with paid dues and any required training.</p>
<p>There are a number of steps involved and someone in your unit will be tasked with completing this task. Done in bite sized steps the process is not too difficult. Wait until the last minute and it can get a little painful for everyone.</p>
<p>If you are in charge of the process or very involved, then be sure and attend the October 26th <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/?OrgKey=BSA571&calendarID=388736"><strong>Roundtable</strong></a> at 7:00PM, FUMC in Richardson.</p>
<p>If you are not, then please pay attention to the instructions, pay dues, complete any paperwork and or training as soon as possible. On-line youth protection is a common sticking point, so get that done now if your card has will will expire soon. Go to <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a> to take the training.</p>
<p>The recharter process will remain the same for this year, Committee Chairs, start gathering your recharter dues! Exclusion: any scouts that have joined starting August 1st have already paid their fees.</p>
<p>New information on 2023 recharter: If you have an existing scout that will need financial assistance on their 2024 recharter fees, you must ensure 2 things as the unit leader</p>
<op>
<li>That the individual family submits their financial aid form by December 1st.</li>
<li>The unit needs to have submitted their recharter by December 1st as well. It does not need to be "final," meaning you may still have defectives and/or add-ons. But, the actual unit recharter itself will need to have been submitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendance at the Recharter Round Table is highly encouraged by the Committee Chair and/or unit leader that will coordinate their unit’s 2024 recharter.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Popcorn</strong></p>
<p>Get out and sell popcorn. It benefits your unit and is vital to supporting our camps and the council operations. Scouts become a part of this process and it is part of learning the value of of the program.</p>

<p>
<p><strong>The Course</strong>: National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) is an exciting, action-packed six-day council-level program designed to provide Scouts in troops, crews, and ships with leadership skills and experience they can use in their home units and other situations demanding leadership of self and others. The course is designed for Scouts BSA members who are at least 13 years old, and for Venturers or Sea Scouts who are at least 13 years old and have completed eighth grade.</p>
<p><strong>What You Will Do And Learn At NYLT:</strong> NYLT is filled with activities, presentations, challenges, discussions, and camping in a team and model unit environment. Participants learn and practice skills that are valuable at home, church, school, work, and the Scouting unit. Content is delivered in a troop and patrol outdoor setting with an emphasis on immediate application of learning in a fun environment. Interconnecting concepts and work processes are introduced early, built upon,and aided by the use of memory aids, which allows participants to understand and employ leadership skills much faster. These skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning ofLeadership. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2023NYLT"><strong>More information</strong></a></p>
