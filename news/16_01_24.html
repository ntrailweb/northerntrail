<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Action Needed</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/camporee-planning-meeting-2">Camporee Planning Meetings</a></strong></p>
<p>Camporee will be held March 18-20 at Camp Constantin. The difference between a good event and a great event is planning. Camporee is work of volunteers and this work must be done not only at Camporee, but during planning meetings in advance of the event. Scout and adult volunteers are needed.</p><p>Step up to the plate and come to the next planning meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 7:00pm, Room 2B in Bartula Family Life Center, First United Methodist Church of Richardson. Volunteering at Camporee is a rewarding experience and the time invested is well spent.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/brian.PNG" style="width: 264px; height: 199px; margin: 5px; float: right;" />Brian Daugherty, Troop 1001, received the first award for Outstanding Eagle Project of the Year at the District Dinner on January 21. Brian&#39;s project has also been nominated for the council&#39;s Outstanding Eagle Project of 2015 recognition.</p><p>Brian planned a multi-weekend effort and directed 23 scouts and adults in renovating the Youth Center at St. Joseph&#39;s Church in Richardson. His team build a set of bookshelves with a large cut-out cross in the center; repaired a large broken cross and placed it in the cut-out; and added writable walls to the area. This project took over 400 hours.</p><p>Brian did competitive shopping to find the best prices for materials, wrote a well-organized and detailed plan, and intentionally used the EDGE method to train his workers. He had to make several adjustments during his project, including how to fasten the shelves to the unexpected aluminum studs in the wall instead of the expected wooden studs.</p><p>His parents are Brian &amp; Denise Daugherty.</p>
