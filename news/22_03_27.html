<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">ALT / IOLS training for Scouts BSA</strong></p>
<p>Scouting works when we have trained leaders and parents. Parents must understand the how and why of scouting. Adult Leader Training, ALT is an introduction to scouting and demonstrates in depth the AIMs and Methods of scouting. A scout’s chances of success in the program will be dramatically improved with trained and involved parents.</p>
<p>Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills, IOLS complements ALT training with details on the how and why of the outdoor program. Participants will function as scouts on an actual campout and be introduced to the details of a successful outdoor program.</p>
<p>Scoutmasters, Assistant Scoutmasters and Committee chairs must be fully trained, and this includes both ALT and IOLS. We encourage parents to, if possible, attend both ALT and IOLS but at a minimum ALT. ALT: Saturday April 9, 2022, at John D. Murchison Scouting Center (Dallas Scouting office). IOLS weekend of Apr 30, 2022, at Camp Wisdom. Sign-up <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022DistrictIOLS">here</a>.</p>
