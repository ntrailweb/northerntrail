		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Annual Program Preview</strong></p>

		<p>Before COVID, we held annual "program previews" which were opportunities for scout leaders and parents to learn about the many programs and resources provided at both the district and council level. We are excited to finally get back to having these informative sessions.</p>
		<p>Expect presentations and handouts on a variety of events and programs.</p>
		<p>Meet your scout executive, commissioner staff, training staff members, district leadership and event coordinators. It's a great opportunity to meet scouters from other units and do a little networking, compare and share program ideas.</p>
 <p>This event will be held Thursday, May 18th at 7PM at First United Methodist Church 501 North Central Expressway in Richardson. 	<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vygaDBagWM6LknbQ7"><strong>Map</strong></a>.</p>
 <p>Mark your calendar and plan to attend.</p>		 
 
		<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">Upcoming Training</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Wilderness First Aid</strong> Wilderness First Aid, a 16-hour class required for all High Adventures Treks, a minimum of two for Philmont and one for the others. It is best to have more trained so that if the person can't go or is injured the crew is still covered. I have the following classes scheduled: May 4-7</strong> at Trinity Bible Church, 400 Campbell Rd, Richardson. The cost is $85. Fri night, 6:30-10:30 pm; Sat 8 am - 4:30 pm; and Sun 12:30-4:30 pm CPR/AED is required and offered the Thursday before is class, at a cost of $40.

			<li> <strong>Youth Protection Training</strong> This training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete this very necessary task.
