<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Fifty Years in Service to Scouting</strong></p>
<p>Recently I heard about a Northern Trail scouter who has more than fifty years of volunteer service to scouting. Ed Carpenter's son Mark,  provided this scouting bio and it is impressive.</p>

<p>Ed began his scouting service as a den Leader in Slidell, Louisiana. The family moved to the Lake Highlands area, where he became involved with Pack and Troop 719 at Saint Patrick’s,  50 years ago.</p>

<p>The father of eight, with 6 sons, he was first a Den Leader and then served as Cub Master for Pack 719 for nine years.</p>

<p>Moving to Troop 719, he was an Asst Scoutmaster for decades and is still a member of Troop Committee today.</p>

<p>A constant particpant is over 20 Summer Camps. He has staffed countless District and Council Events.</p>

<p>Ed has been awarded several scouting awards including; the District Award of Merit, Silver Beaver, Bronze Pelican, and Saint George.</p>

<p><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/carpenter.jpg"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/carpenter_thumb.jpg"></a>Three of his sons made Eagle and two of his sons have been awarded District Award of Merit and Silver Beavers for work in Northern Trail.</p>

<p>To this day Ed loves to support Scouts, no matter what unit you are in. Even if just by showing an interest and cheering them on.  Parents in the neighborhood come to him with questions about scouts.  Ed can’t do any more Philmont Treks or Camping anymore.  But his Scouting Spirit still burns brightly.</p>

<p><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/carpenter.jpg">Here</a> is an early photo of Ed at Philmont in 1973, 45 years ago. Ed is in the middle row second from the left. Oldest son Mark is bottom left. At time this photo was taken, Ed was Cub master with a son waiting to join the Pack.  Every scout on this Trek, became an Eagle Scout!</p>

<p>Ed, thanks for your service to scouting and to the countless lives impacted by your example.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://circleten.org/youth-protection-training-update">Youth Protection Training</a></strong></p>
<p>We now have only one approved Youth Protection Certificate and everyone will have to have the <strong>new</strong> card by October 1st. To protect not only our youth, but adult volunteers as well, this course has been updated to clearly define how we implement the program.  For Summer camp this year, a valid Face-to-Face YPT card will be acceptable, but will be invalid after <strong>October 1st 2018.</strong>  If you need an approved card for Summer Camp, take the course at <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>.  Here are some <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/ypt-training-tips">YPT Training Tips</a> to make the process a little easier. </p>
<p>Now is a great time to get needed training completed and out of the way.  Hazardous Weather Training is required for front line leaders. There are a world of on-line training courses available on <a href="http://my.scouting.org">my.scouting.org</a>. A great example is the driving safety course. Even with more than fifty years of driving, I learned a few good tips watching this class. Remember you can't re-charter your unit unless every adult has the undated YPT training certificate.  Avoid the rush, get it done now. <p>Questions can be emailed to  <a href="mailto:571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org">571CircleTenTraining@scouting.org</a>.</p>

<p>Scouting units run on popcorn...and hike and camp and swim, too. The sale not only builds leadership and confidence but it allows a Scout to learn the value of earning their own way.</p>

<p><img align="left" hspace="10" src="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/sites/circleten.org/files/media/district/nt/ww_2018_small.png">Here is a great opportunity to get help up and coming Boy Scouts get a great launch into the Boy Scout program. Troops are needed to help staff this event. If you are interested in staffing, please attend the planning meeting in FUMC-R, room 225, 7-8:30 pm May 16, June 20, July 25, Aug. 15 and Sept. 12.
The theme for Webelos Woods is “Scout Skills”. Scout Troops are encouraged to volunteer for STAFF in the following areas:  Compass, First Aid (making kits),  Knife & Axe (safe use and cleaning), Dutch Oven Cooking, First Aid bandage ( using neckerchief), Tug- a-war,  String Burning, Campsite inspections, and other events TBD.  Remember the idea is to have experienced scouts STAFF these areas and not Adults.  
Cost for event has been set at $10.00 for Cub and Cub Adult.
Cubs and Scout Troops provide their own food.
