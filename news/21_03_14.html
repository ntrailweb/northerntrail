The skills come alive during the week as the patrol goes on a Quest for the Meaning of Leadership. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2021NYLT?fbclid=IwAR26pr2ekIzf4lG2_UM3gFYfxK0hqur9e91U5qXU2WdWyTUdTpzW3Qj_eSk">More information.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">2021 Friends of Scouting Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we need robust Scouting programs to teach the next generation life skills learned on the journey to Eagle. We need FOS funding to keep our programs vibrant and relevant. Once the snow melts and life returns to a more normal rhythm, I am asking you to please give serious consideration to one of the following FOS giving options:
</p><ul>
<li>Going on-line and making a personal contribution today</li>
<li>Reaching out to your employer for corporate matching funds</li>
<li>Volunteering to help with our fundraising efforts through networking</li>
<li>Inviting one of our FOS speakers to your next Scouting event such as a Blue & Gold or Court of Honor</li>
<li>Establishing a connection between Vaughn Dubose or Trey Otte and one or more of your Unit’s “Key Three” leaders.</li>
</ul>
<p>***If your pack or troop is only holding virtual events, we would love a chance to speak during one of your online meetings this spring. 
Please reach out to Vaughn Dubose, FOS Family Chairperson, at vaughndubose@gmail.com or Trey Otte, 2021 Friends of Scouting Chairperson, at trey@otte.us if you are able to help in any way. Thank you so much.
