<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/fall-training">Unit Leadership Contact Check</a></strong></p>

<p>One of the major challenges we have in the district is keeping unit leaders informed about upcoming events, training and other opportunities in the district and the council.   In addition to changes in leadership, phone numbers and email addresses are changing constantly.  Please take a moment and let us know the contact information for your unit Chair and Leader.  We will match this information with what we have and verify the new information.  Use the online form found here:  <strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-leadership-check">northerntrail.circleten.org/unit-leadership-check</a></strong>.  Don't worry about duplicates, we will sort it out!</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">Adult Recognition</a></strong></p>

<p>This is the time of the year we think about who in Northern Trail should be recognized for their scouting efforts; this can be at the unit and/or district and council level.</p>

<p>At the unit level we have the Y.E.S.-Your Extraordinary Service Award, each unit can nominate 2 adults and 1 more for every additional 50 youth in the unit. Adults activity at district level- OA and District Committee can be nominated as well. The unit determines who receives the award.</p>

<p>The District Award of Merit is a council award presented by the district at their annual dinner. This person could have chaired one event or/and been involved in many scouting activities. A district committee selects the awardees from the nominations.</p>

<p>The Robert E. Little Award is a district award for long service to scouting. The district selects one person each year.</p>

<p>Additional information along with nomination forms for these three awards are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0">northerntrail.circleten.org/adult-recognition-0</a> Additional supporting information can be included for the District Award of Merit and Robert E. Little awards. The deadline for each of these is Dec 1, 2016</p>

<p>The Silver Beaver is a the highest council award for scouters. The district gathers the nominations and forwards them to council. These scouters have made significant contributions to the scouting movement over a number of years. Additional information and forms are found at <a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award">northerntrail.circleten.org/silver-beaver-award</a> Additional supporting information can be added. The deadline is Nov 1, 2016.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist">Re-Charter Time is Here</a></strong></p>

<p>It is time to re-charter your unit. Every adult must have a current Youth Protection card. Either the on-line version or the face-to-face version. Face-to-face is required for some activities like Twilight Camp and Summer Camp. Leaders must have specific training for their position.  Start working re-charter now!  If you are not in charge of recharter, help out the person who is by completing any needed training and paying your dues on time.<a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/recharter-checklist">Re-charter Checklist</a></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://northerntrail.circleten.org/popcorn-exchange">Popcorn Exchange</a></strong></p>

<p>We hope you have experienced very successful CAMP MASTERS Show and Sell and Take Order sales this year. Popcorn Take Orders were due last Friday, October 14. Scouts still have time to sell, though, as Online Sales close November 11 (at a commission rate of 30%).</p>
<p>If you do have Scouts selling online, you may wait until after November 11 to place your PRIZE order; however, if your Scouts arenâ€™t selling online, please place your prize orders this week.
