<p style="font-size:18px;"><strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/recharter-clinic">Re-Charter Clinic</a></strong> </p>

<p>It's re-charter time. Every unit must complete the re-charter process annually. The deadline for all units is fast approaching. If you get started early, it's not all that difficult. Wait until the last minute and it can be a real headache. If you are not responsible for the process, you can help by getting your dues, any applications or needed youth protection forms into your unit chair as soon as possible. If you are responsible for your unit re-charter, help is available. A re-charter <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/recharter-clinic">clinic</a></strong> will be held on December 5th at the RISD Administration building at 7:00 PM. 


<p>Here is a handy <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/re-charter-checklist">checklist </a></strong>
which will help you to be prepared. You can get your paperwork checked and turned in without having to go to the service center. <strong><a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/recharter-clinic"

<p<img align=left hspace=5 vspace=5 src="http://ntrail.org/sites/default/files/u1/small_BSACircleTenLogo.jpg">Scouting depends on volunteers and contributions to make the program run. Please take a moment to schedule a time for a presenter to come to your Court of Honor or Blue and Gold Banquet and make a short presentation about Friends of Scouting. It will only take a about 15 minutes. It 's essential that our local Circle Ten Council have adequate funds to implement this great program with the necessary camps, professional staff and service centers. Without these assets the program could not function. If you have questions contact: Jesus Vazquez <a href="mailto:Jesus.Vazquez@scouting.org">Jesus.Vazquez@scouting.org</a></p>

Make your reservation <a href="http://ntrail.org/?q=content/schedule-friends-scouting-presentations-0"><span style="font-weight:bold;">here</span></a> and someone will contact you to confirm.
