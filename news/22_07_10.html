<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Summertime Activities</strong></p>
<p>It's mid-July and it won't be long until school starts. However, there is still time for a pick-up unit activity at a local park. A cook-out, games and general fun is an easy activity to pull together. The hardest part is picking a date and location. Once you have done that, then you just need to get the word out and divide up the tasks. Get your scouts to invite their non-scout friends and their parents for a taste of scouting.</p> 

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Can Prospective Scouts Find Your Unit?</strong></p>
<p>More than once I heard the complaint that it's difficult to find a nearby scout unit. A great exercise is to ask the question; "If I did not belong to a unit, how would I find this unit?" A good place ot start is the <a href="https://beascout.scouting.org/">beascout.scouting.org</a> website. Is the information about your unit there and is it correct? Many scout units are associated with a faith based organization. Is your unit promoted by this organization? A service event for the organization will build a better relationship and new scouts will come your way. Facebook and NextDoor are also good ways to promote your unit in your immediate area. Unless you gain members your unit will not thrive and eventually fade away. Don't let that happen.</p>


<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Popcorn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Popcorn pays for: campouts, annual dues & recharter, uniforms, patches, unit supplies & equipment, and a whole lot of FUN!!!</li>
<li>Commit to the sale here. Even if you are not sure who your unit kernel is, have 1 leader sign up. It is imperative that you get in the system early so your unit can begin preparing and receiving information from Trail’s End.</li>
<li>We have a LOCAL Richardson Popcorn kickoff so that it’s more accessible to the leaders – it’s in the neighborhood! Here’s the link to signup: <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022PopcornKickoffRichardson">https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022PopcornKickoffRichardson</a></li>
<li>Have questions??? Contact your District Popcorn Kernel, Amy Weems by phone or email for help: 817-891-0736, <a href="mailto:amy.weems82@gmail.com">amy.weems82@gmail.com</a> </li>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold"><a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://ntrail.org/arapahochapter">Arapaho Chapter News</a></strong></p>
<p>The Order of the Arrow is an honor camper service <a href="https://oa-bsa.org/about/mission-purpose">organization.</a> Each district has a chapter and members are chosen by their peers.</p>
<p>Contact <a href="mailto:adviser@arapahochapter.org">adviser@arapahochapter.org</a> with questions.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Membership</strong> </p>
<p>Membership is a year-round activity. Don't jeopardize the future of your unit by failing to attract new members. Those who came before you made your unit possible. Consider the future scouts who will benefit from their experience in scouting.</p>
<p>Please contact Katherine McCrary	<a href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a> if you can help with recruiting.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p> 
<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>
<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p>
