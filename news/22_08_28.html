<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">We are all Mentors</strong></p>
<p>One definition of a mentor is: "a person who can support, advise and guide you."</p>
<p>This is the time of year that many new scouts and their parents join units. Scouting can be very daunting with lots of unfamiliar terms and activities. It can be just a little bit overwhelming. Even if you have only been involved for a short time, you are in a position to mentor these new parents. Take the time to talk with them and explain what is going on and how the program works. Make sure that new parents understand that scouting is about "fun with a purpose." The purpose is embodied in the aims and methods of scouting and this is why the program exists. Scouting is not simple entertainment.</p>
<p>Explain the value of the program and that if they help even in a small way this will show their scout that the program is important to them. Their scout will notice, and be more likely to stay in the program.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">School Night For Scouting</strong> </p>
<p>If you have free evenings on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday over the next 2 months and want to pitch in for recruitment… text our DE, Katherine McCrary, to assist with registration check-out and guide new parents at SNFS Nights. She has the schedule for you to sign-up. Would love any help we can get! Please contact Katherine McCrary	<a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org">Katherine.McCrary@scouting.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Popcorn Fund Raising</strong></p>
<p>The annual Popcorn sale is now in progress and if your unit has not signed up to participate, it's not too late. The popcorn sale is a vital part of the overall income to the council, and it supports not only the council, but your unit and scouts benefit as well.</p>
<p>Contact our District Popcorn Kernel, Amy Weems by phone or email for help: 817-891-0736, <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="mailto:amy.weems82@gmail.com">amy.weems82@gmail.com</a>. More information <a href="https://circleten.org/posts/30562/popcorn">here.</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>Now is the time to get signed up for training. Unit leaders, send new parents to training.</p>
<p>Youth Protection Training (YPT) is only valid for two years. Every adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete this required task. On-line at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a>.</p> 
<p>In addition to YPT, every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTFallLST">Leader Specific Training (LST)</a> is coming up Saturday October 8th and is for Scouts BSA leaders and parents. Sign up on-line. This is a two part course and the outdoor part, <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTiols">Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills (ILST)</a> is the weekend of October 21-23. There are separate sign-ups for both. <a href="https://scoutingevent.com/571-2022NTBALOO">Basic Adult Outdoor Orientation (BALOO)</a> for Cub Scout Leaders is the weekend of October 21-23.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now. Even if you are not doing the actual re-charter, you can help by getting your tasks done on-time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
<li>Make Contact with your COR</li>
