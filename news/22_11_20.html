<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Thanksgiving</strong></p>
<p>This week we will celebrate Thanksgiving. Most of us expect to sit down to a special meal with family and friends and maybe catch a big game on TV. This holiday of course is intended to reflect on the blessings we have and consider the value of family, friends, and community. Scouting is a gift which was inspired by Baden Powell more than 100 years ago as a way for young people to grow in character and life skills. I’m thankful for this gift and the continued gifts of time and treasure to the program. Without the diligence of these volunteers the program cannot survive. Scouting has faced challenges over the years but has prevailed because of the vision of Baden Powell and those who came after him. I challenge you to consider the value of these gifts as we give thanks. Please consider what you can do for scouting. Scouting’s most challenging problem is enough adult leadership. Your unit leaders can always use help. You can help with the load. So, ask, “what can I do to help?” If you are a unit leader, don’t hesitate to ask for help. Too often people fail to recognize the need.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Training</strong></p>
<p>Youth Protection training is only valid for two years. Every registered adult must have a current card. Don't wait until the last minute to complete is very necessary task. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://my.scouting.org"><strong>my.scouting.org</strong></a></p> 
<p>In addition to YPT every leader must be position trained. There are specific training programs for each of the many positions in scouting.</p>
<p>Beyond position training, Hazardous weather training is also required, so don't overlook this as well.</p>
<p>We have in-person training opportunities coming including Adult Leader Training (ALT) for scouts BSA, Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills IOLS for Scouts BSA and Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation for Cub Scouts and Webelos.</p><p>Watch the <a href="https://ntrail.org/Scouts/northerntrail.circleten.org/calendar-events"><span style="font-weight:bold;">calendar</span></a> and newsletter for information about available training.<p>

<p><strong style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold">Annual Re-Charter</strong></p>
<p>Every unit must re-charter their unit each year. This involves several steps. You can start working on this now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update rosters both youth and adult.</li>
<li>Review training status for every adult. Current Youth Protection is required.</li>
<li>Collect adult and scout applications if required.</li>
<li>Collect fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Start now and this process will be much easier. Wait until the last minute and it is hard on everyone. Help is available, just ask!</p>
