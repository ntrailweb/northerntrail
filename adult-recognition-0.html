<h2>Adult Recognition</h2>
 
 <p>The district holds a recognition dinner, usually in February of each year to recognize its hard-working adult leaders and volunteers. Nominations must be received before the published deadlines to ensure that the selections can be made in time for the event. Watch the calendar for the exact dates.</p> 
 
 <p style="font-size:1.2em; style:italilc; font-weight:bold;"> Self-nominations will not be accepted.</p>
 
<p>There are several awards in Scouting which recognize adults who make contributions to scouting.</p>
<p>Assistance: <a href="district-leadership-0.html"> See district leadership page</a> for name and email address for the current Awards and Recognition Chairperson.</span></p>

We have many scouters in Northern Trail that could be nominated and you could easily be that person who gets their nomination started. Think about the scouters you have seen at events in the last year and could you nominate one of them. If you have questions about how to get the needed information ask other scouters who might know. Also you can contact the chairperson for  assistance:  <a href="district-leadership-0.html">See district leadership page</a>  for name and email address for the current Awards and Recognition Chairperson.</p>
